  "Overview": "MIB: Alien Crisis is an action game loosely based on the film Men in Black 3. You control Peter Delacoeur, a thief who attempts to steal an ancient Egyptian artifact for Emilio Chauncey. Unbeknownst to Delacoeur however, Chauncey is an alien and plans to use the item as a tool towards taking over the world. After surviving Chauncey’s plans to have him killed and successfully fending off a batch of aliens, Delacoeur is caught by MIB and taken away for questioning. After a failed attempt to escape headquarters Delacoeur is forced to undergo a VR mission for training purposes and eventually becomes an MIB agent under the name Agent P. He is partnered with Catyana (Agent C) in an attempt to thwart Chauncey of his plans, recover the artifact and save the world.\n\nThe story has eight chapters which mostly consists of a 3rd-person shooter environment. You unlock different kinds of weapons throughout the game such as the BANGer and the Noisy Cricket. You also use attachments and unlock a variety of those during the game, including the Icer (which freezes the enemy) and the Cerebo Accelerator (which slows everything down). You also take a ride on the flying car where you shoot aliens and use EMPs and rocket launchers.\n\nThere are also twelve VR Missions to take part in with friends. There’s a competitive mode where the highest scorer in the mission wins, co-op and hotseat for up to four players.",
