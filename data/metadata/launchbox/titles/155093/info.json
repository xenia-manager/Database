  "Overview": "Koron de JUMP!! is a colorful and simple auto-scrolling platformer. The player controls Koron, a small girl who carries a leaf. After the bird she and her brother are riding on is attacked, she must set off to find this bird and her brother. Each stage scrolls automatically to the right, and the player must jump over hazards while collecting acorns, using the leaf to float when necessary. Sometimes a red balloon will appear, which if collected will make extra bonus acorns appear. There are also short bonus stages where bonus acorns can be collected.",
