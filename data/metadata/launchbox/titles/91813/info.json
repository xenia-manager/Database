  "Overview": "Ride to Hell: Retribution is an action game that incorporates different gameplay elements. The game is set in 1969 in America and has Jake Conway as the protagonist, a biker and Vietnam veteran. When he comes back he goes to live with his brother Mikey and uncle Mack. When his brother is killed in a gang-related murder by a rival biker gang, he goes on a quest for vengeance.\n\nThe game combines driving sections on a bike while fighting off bikers and dodging obstacles similar to the Road Rash games, on-foot sections with exploration and combat based on blocking, melee and ranged weapons, and rail shooter driving sections where someone else takes the wheel and Jake gets to aim and shoot as a sidecar gunner. All types of gameplay incorporate many quick time events, both in combat and while driving. Other game elements include chases (with jumps, power slides and obstacles that need to be dodged) and pursuits, hunting, deliveries and saving girls. The story is largely furthered through cut-scenes and new locations are often reached after long driving sections. Most missions have a time limit. Jake's bike can be customized through decals, paint jobs and body parts. The game features a rock soundtrack by the band Rival Sons.",
