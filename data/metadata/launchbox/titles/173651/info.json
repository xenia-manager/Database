  "Overview": "PES 2017: Pro Evolution Soccer can be seen as an interim improvement over its predecessor, PES 2016. The rosters were mostly updated for the 2016/17 season, the first touch of the ball is calculated through individual player's statistics, improved passing is stressed, advanced team instructions have been included to allow elaborate strategies like the Tiki-Taka, new on-the-fly options have been added during the match, and the AI and visual presentation have been given a boost. Goalkeepers have seen several individual improvements of their own, such as deflection when a shot is near their feet, reactivity to unexpected side shots, and fingertip saves for shots as they approach the goal line. The myClub mode now has Scout and Auction options.",
