  "Overview": "Unlike most of the previous 2D Worms games, Worms Ultimate Mayhem features a 3D, turn-based artillery strategy that allows player to move freely rather from left and right. In the game lobby, players are able to choose from a wide variety of different weapons and use them when the game starts. At the start of the game each player is able to control four worms, due to the game turned-base nature, each player control one worm at a time with a set time limit; when the time limit expires or when the worm fires a weapon, the player's turn will end and the opponent will start his turn. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of the enemy team worms. There are two ways that a worm can be eliminated. The simplest way is to deplete the worm of its health, that can be done by choosing a weapon, aiming it at the enemy worm, and firing at the opposing team worm. The second way is to knock the worm out of the platform; some weapons provide the ability to push or knock back the opposing worm. Once a worm is eliminated, it cannot be brought back to life and once all four of a player's worms are eliminated the game will end. The team with worms left standing is the winner.",
