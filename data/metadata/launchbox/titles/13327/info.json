The player's goal is to disrupt the armies of both the North and South by any means necessary, including stopping enemy supply lines, stealing ironclad ships and sabotaging enemy strongholds. Engage in some of the Civil War's most famous battles, such as The Great Train Raid of 1861 and The Fall of Vicksburg as you utilize classic weapons of the era, including the pepperbox revolver and the coffee mill gun. All missions are based on the actions of famous partisans, scouts and rangers â€“ fight as a member of Mosby's Rangers, Sheridan's Scouts and Grant's Secret Service and receive your mission commands from famous generals like Robert E. Lee, \"Stonewall\" Jackson, and Ulysses Grant.",
