  "Overview": "SBK 09: Superbike World Championship is the official licensed game from the motorcycle Superbike World Championship league. The main focus lies on the realistic simulation of the driving physics. During the season the player takes the role of one of 27 licensed athletes and compete in 13 of the race locations of the season 2008/2009 (the NÃ¼rburgring is not in available). There are up to eight sessions per race, including free training and warm ups. In the garage the player can tune almost every aspect of his bike in detail. Beginners this can be delegated to an engineer. Of course there is also the option to play just a single racing weekend or to start in a quick race. \n\nIn comparison to its predecessor there are two notable changes: driving helps for novice players and 20 challenges. In these the player either has to solve certain problems in pre-defined situations, e.g. winning the race with worn out brakes or reaching checkpoints in a limited time frame.",
