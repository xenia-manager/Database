  "Overview": "Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends is a racing game based on a downgraded version of the SHIFT 2 Unleashed engine by the same development team. Players get to take every single Ferrari model ever made out onto the race track. The main campaign is divided into 3 eras; Golden (1947 to 1973), Silver (1974 to 1990) and the Modern era (1991 to 2011). The player can switch between eras as they see fit but cannot progress in an era until the current mission is completed. The missions include beating lap times in a set number of laps, advancing a set number of positions with two laps left in a race, or trying to keep the distance to another car for a set number of laps. All the missions are loosely tied together by a storyline.\n\nThere are over fifty Ferrari models to unlock and 36 classic racing tracks taken from real life. Apart from the campaign mode the game offers Free Play where any unlocked car can be drive, as well as Online play for up to eight players in a single race.",
