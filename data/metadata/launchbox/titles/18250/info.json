  "Overview": "Star Trek is a cooperative action game based on the movie reboot of the franchise in 2009, and released as a tie-in with the second film Star Trek Into Darkness. Based on the same canon, the game's events are set between the two films. Players can play as one of two characters, Captain James T. Kirk, or his second in command, Commander Spock. The whole game is co-op, with an AI player or friend playing whichever character you do not play as. Playing alone characters can only be switched between chapters and not during gameplay. With another player, a drop-in mechanic is supported. The antagonist of the game is the Gorn, an evil reptilian race, who attack a New Vulcan colony through a rip in space. \n\nThe game revolves around a cooperative mindset, with players playing off each others different skill sets. Each character has a distinct set of abilities, with Captain Kirk being a more typical shooter, armed with a phaser with a stun setting, and Commander Spock, a more stealth based character armed with a couple of abilities as well as a gun with a freeze setting. As the player plays through the game, they gain experience by scanning objects, hacking and discovering audio logs. Experience is used to unlock additional abilities for their respective weapons. The tricorder offers many shooting options and the characters have the ability to rewire turrets and hack flying drones. The two characters can help each other out by boosting shields and weapons.\n\nNext to the corridor-based shooting gameplay, there is a space battle with turrets and many platforming sections. Certain stages are set in space, where characters need to dodge debris and a single level contains underwater sections.",
