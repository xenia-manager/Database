  "Overview": "Collecting medals is the primary scoring mechanic in the game. When an enemy is destroyed using the lard attack, they will drop medals shaped like a pig's head. If enemies are destroyed with the lard attack while a bomb is being used, they will drop \"p\" items instead of medals. Also, Single medals will periodically drop from enemies even if they are not destroyed using the lard attack.\nThe medal value starts at 100 points. If there are already medals on screen, the medals that enemies drop will be of an equal value to the medals on screen. If there are no medals on screen, the medal value will increase by 100 points (if the previous value was  1000 points), or 1000 points (if the previous value was  1000 points). The medal value will max out at 10,000 points.\nIf the player switches from the B-shot to the A-shot, all medals on screen will be automatically collected. If the player fails to collect the last medal on screen, the medal value will divide by a factor of 10. The player is awarded an extend every 10 million points. An extend item can also be found if the third stage mid-boss is destroyed using the pierce shot.\nAccessing the second loop requires completing the first five stages without losing a single life. If the extend item is collected in stage 3, the player can die once and still proceed to the second loop. Stages 6â€“10 are identical to the first five stages, but are much more difficult. In addition to this, score extends are no longer awarded.",
