  "Overview": "Race Pro is a driving sim developed by the acclaimed sim specialist Simbin exclusively for the Xbox 360. Unlike SimBin's PC racing games it features the new Lizard game engine. Race Pro is the company's first console game. Unlike a lot of current racing games, Race Pro features real life racing events that include the WTCC, Formula 3000 and Formula BMW, and feature tracks like Macau and Porto, as well as Laguna Seca in the US.\n\nAs with many other racing games, you will have driver assists to help you round the track, but this can be turned off completely if unwanted. As well as the standard controller, you can also use all of the major force feedback controllers that are available for the 360. The majority of the people featured in Race Pro are real people, and features all the 2007 WTCC drivers as well as other famous drivers such as Tiff Needel and Tor Graves.\n\nMultiplayer allows you to take on 12 other players via either a system link or Xbox Live, over varying amounts of laps, which can be adjusted from 2 to 75 laps per race. Alternatively, you can have an offline game against several A.I. opponents.\n\nCars manufacturers include Seat, BMW, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Dodge and Chevrolet, as well as the F3000 car for the Formula 3000 racing events.",
