  "Overview": "Take to enemy territory in your heavily armored tank as you attempt to infiltrate an underground laboratory. Fight your way through waves of mechanical foes and infantry alike, and if the going gets too tough, team up with a friend. You can even hop out of your tank when you need to squeeze into tight spots to access secret areas! \n\nAssault Heroes is a top-down auto-scrolling shooter, similar to Commando. However, instead of merely tackling foes on foot, you've got a tricked-out tank at your disposal, complete with nukes, guns, flamethrowers, shotguns, and more - and don't forget that your weapons are fully upgradeable! If your tank takes too much damage, it will explode and you'll have to tough it out on foot while you wait for it to respawn. In addition, some sections can only be accessed on foot, and there are also underground bases to conquer. These are much tougher, as it's easier to die as a mere soldier than an armored tank.",
