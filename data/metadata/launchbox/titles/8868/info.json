  "Overview": "Whether you play solo or with friends, \"Hole in the Wall\" challenges you to become a human puzzle piece as you contort to fit through wacky shapes that are cut out into themed walls hurtling towards you. Try to pass your body through the wall to boost your score, or you’ll be pushed straight into the water below! Play through different “show” levels in single or multi player modes (up to 4 competitors), or see if you can handle the challenge of “survival” mode as you attack wall after wall until you drop! Unlock special customization elements for your avatar like a silver spandex suit, helmets, t-shirt and other zany gear as a reward for progress in the game.",
