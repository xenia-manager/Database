  "Overview": "A new entry in the Vandal Hearts series, Flames of Judgement follows the story of young orphan Tobias Martin as he bands together with his schoolmates to help defend his homeland against a rival kingdom. The story acts as a prequel to the original Vandal Hearts.\n\nThe series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D character models. Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat.\n\nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made. In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple \"secret maps\" unlocked across the regular levels.",
