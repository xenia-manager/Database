  "Overview": "Players can once again choose from a cast of noble Autobots or evil Decepticons and battle to determine the fate of Earth as Hasbro's \"robots in disguise\" return for their second feature film, and second movie-based game, in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The single-player campaign gives gamers a glimpse of the action from both perspectives of the ongoing war, with players taking control of Bumblebee, Optimis Prime, or other Autobots in one mission, then commanding Starscream or Megatron in another. A new transforming system lets gamers switch from robot mode, to vehicle mode, to weapon mode on the fly, and each robot comes equipped with a special ability and several upgradeable weapons and skills. Multiplayer fans can head online to team up with or take on friends in \"Deathmatch\" and \"Team Deathmatch\" modes, attempt to take out the opposing faction's leader in \"One Shall Stand\" mode, strategically capture sections of the map in \"Control Points\" mode, and collect pieces of the Allspark in \"Battle for the Shards\"",
