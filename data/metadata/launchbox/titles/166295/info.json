  "Overview": "MotoGP '07 is the 2007 installment of THQ's motorcycle racing series, having all the season data accurate for the year.\n\nAs in its predecessors, one big part of the game is the championship mode in which you choose one of the real drivers and drive with him to the top. However, the new heart of the game is the Racing career. There you not only create your very own character but you also fully customize your own ride from the general look to nearly every bolt inside. Every GrandPrix features the three stages practice, qualifying and race but you don't need to go through all of them. In addition there are three challenges for every course like Speed Run in which you've 45 seconds to reach the goal and if you're fast enough you can earn either a bronze, silver or a gold medal. The qualifying and race are also watched by the program and you can fulfill several goals like being 1st in qualifying or being on the podium at the end of the race.\n\nAt the end of each GrandPrix you not only get some money to invest into your ride but you also gain some credits with which you increase the stats of your character in the four talent \"Cornering\", \"Braking\", \"Top Speed\" and \"Acceleration\" to make him more like a Pro.\n\nThe fictional \"Extreme\"-mode is also part of the game again and the 17 old tracks have been revised and 20 new motorcycles are waiting to be driven around the courses in both single player and multiplayer.",
