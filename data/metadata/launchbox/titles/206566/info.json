  "Overview": "In MLB Stickball, gamers can buy and collect packs of Topps Big Head major league baseball cards. Each time a pack is opened, those players are unlocked and added to each major league team to play! Part of the fun of stickball is the custom rules for each city, just like the rules kids create when they play in their own neighborhoods! MLB Stickball can be played on the streets of a number of big cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Boston. In addition to scoring runs in the stickball game itself, there will be objects scattered throughout each environment that serve as targets or hazards for the batter. If you smack the ball off the fire hydrant and get it to spray water into the street, your team will be richly rewarded; break a window, though, and youre out!",
