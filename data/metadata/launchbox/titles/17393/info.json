  "Overview": "Final Fantasy XI (ファイナルファンタジーXI Fainaru Fantajī Irebun?), also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), developed and published by Square (later Square Enix) as part of the Final Fantasy series. Designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, it was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows-based personal computers in November of that year. The game was the first cross-platform MMORPG and the Xbox 360's first MMORPG.[1] All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.[2]\n\nThe story is set in the fantasy world of Vana'diel, where player-created avatars can both compete and cooperate in a variety of objectives to develop an assortment of jobs, skills, and earn in-game item rewards. Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in-game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game. Since its debut in 2002, five expansion packs have been released[3] along with six add-on scenarios. Each expansion pack and add-on brings a new major storyline to the Final Fantasy XI world, along with numerous areas, quests, events and item rewards.\n\nIn March 2015, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XI would receive one more final main scenario (spread out over three parts in 2015). The servers for the game PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions will be shut down in 2016.[4] A mobile client for the game is under development by Square Enix in collaboration with Korean developer Nexon,[5] and a spinoff mobile game, Final Fantasy Grandmasters is under development with a 2015 release date.",
