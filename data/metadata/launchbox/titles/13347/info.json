  "Overview": "Gears of War Triple Pack contains the original Gears of War, Gears of War 2, and the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, which includes the \"Road to Ruin\" campaign and 19 multiplayer maps.\n\nUnlike other shooters, Gears of War is all about teamwork in a big way. All game modes, levels and scenarios are designed specifically to encourage co-operative play, whether it be with A.I. partners or human players (with A.I. teammates designed with specific strengths, weaknesses and personalities.) On top of that, voice recognition will be available for players, and obviously voice chat to discuss strategy with your friends. In addition to voice chat, gamers will be able to experience individualized matchmaking, view player statistics, earn player achievements, customize their games, and build and personalize their gamer profiles over Xbox Live.\n\n\nGears of War 2 continues the story of Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad, locked in an increasingly desperate battle against the nightmarish Locust Horde for the survival of humanity. The game promises to be an epic saga of survival, loss, and retribution. Just as Gears of War set the standard for high-definition visuals, Gears of War 2 raises the bar even further with the amazing technological advances of Unreal Engine 3, delivering a bigger, badder, and more intense experience as the story continues.\n\n\nGears of War 2: All Fronts Collection includes the \"Road to Ruin\" campaign and 19 multiplayer maps for additional gameplay action.",
