  "Overview": "Rock Band Track Packs (called Song Packs in Europe and Australia)[1] are a series of supplemental media discs for the Rock Band series of music video games. The packs are developed by Harmonix and Demiurge Studios (earlier packs were developed with Pi Studios), and distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. Harmonix has announced they will release additional discs, containing new songs not in past releases, and have not previously been made available through downloadable content. The track packs are fully functional stand alone games and do not require separate Rock Band titles to play;[2] however, on consoles that support downloadable content, the songs from these packs can be integrated with other Rock Band titles.\n\n\nRock Band Country Track Pack[edit]\nRock Band Country Track Pack\nDeveloper(s)\tHarmonix, Demiurge Studios\nPublisher(s)\tMTV Games\nDistributor(s)\tEA Distribution\nSeries\tRock Band\nPlatform(s)\tXbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii\nRelease date(s)\tXbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii\nNA July 21, 2009\n[15]\nGenre(s)\tMusic\nMode(s)\tSingle player, multiplayer\nHarmonix released a fifth track pack for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and PlayStation 2. The disc features 21 songs, and for the first time includes songs never before seen in the Rock Band series. These songs were exclusive to Rock Band Country Track Pack for a limited time before being released to the Rock Band Music Store by late 2009 and early 2010. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions also include a code to export the songs to a hard drive for use in other Rock Band games. The Track Pack can also be played as a standalone game for all systems in the same manner as the AC/DC Track Pack and Track Pack Vol. 2.[15]\n\nThe setlist includes the following songs:[15]\n\nSong title\tArtist\tDecade\tGenre\n\"3 Dimes Down\"\tDrive-By Truckers\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Any Man of Mine\"a\tShania Twain\t1990s\tCountry\n\"Can't Let Go\"\tLucinda Williams\t1990s\tCountry\n\"Cry Lonely\"a\tCross Canadian Ragweed\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\"\tDierks Bentley\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Gone\"a\tMontgomery Gentry\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Good Time\"a\tAlan Jackson\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Gunpowder & Lead\"\tMiranda Lambert\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Hillbilly Deluxe\"\tBrooks & Dunn\t2000s\tCountry\n\"I Told You So\"a\tKeith Urban\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Me and My Gang\"a\tRascal Flatts\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Mud on the Tires\"\tBrad Paisley\t2000s\tCountry\n\"On the Road Again\"a\tWillie Nelson\t1980s\tCountry\n\"Satellite Radio\"\tSteve Earle\t2000s\tCountry\n\"She's Country\"a\tJason Aldean\t2000s\tCountry\n\"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\"a\tKenny Chesney\t1990s\tCountry\n\"Sin Wagon\"\tDixie Chicks\t1990s\tCountry\n\"Swing\"a\tTrace Adkins\t2000s\tCountry\n\"Suds in the Bucket\"a\tSara Evans\t2000s\tCountry\n\"The Gambler\"a\tKenny Rogers\t1970s\tCountry\n\"This One's for the Girls\"a\tMartina McBride\t2000s\tCountry\n^a Songs were first released to Rock Band through this disc.",
