  "Overview": "After the mysterious and untimely death of the Emperor, the throne of Tamriel lies empty. With the Empire ready to crumble, the gates of Oblivion open and demons march upon the land - laying waste to everything in their path. To turn the tide of darkness, you must find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to destroy all of Tamriel.\n\nCelebrating the fifth anniversary of the celebrated The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, this package allows players who have never played the 2006 Game of the Year to experience Oblivion in its complete form. In addition, gamers can continue their existing games of Oblivion and experience the new quests and areas offered by the expansion and downloadable content.\n\nIncluded in this package is the Game of the Year release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (featuring the original game and the official expansions Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine) plus a bonus making-of disc and a game map. Specially-marked packages of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (5th Anniversary Edition) also come with a coupon for use towards the purchase of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.",
