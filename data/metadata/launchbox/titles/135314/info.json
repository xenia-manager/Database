  "Overview": "Star Wars: Battlefront III was a video game in development at Free Radical Design starting in 2006, and was to be the third installment in the original Battlefront series. It was eventually cancelled in 2008.\n\nBuilding up on the legacy of the two previous games, Battlefront III would have made possible for players to seamlessly transition from ground battle to space battle, by taking of or landing a spaceship.\n\nThe vast majority of what is known about Battlefront III can be tracked down to a few online articles published in 2012 by specialized outlets, based on statements from parties directly involved. Free Radical Design developers, in particular three of its co-founders: Steve Ellis, David Doak, and Graeme Norgate, would be featured on articles by Gameindustry.biz and Eurogamer. Differing statements between the developers would claim the game was anywhere from 75% to 99% complete.",
