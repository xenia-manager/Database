  "Overview": "Scrap Metal is a top-down car-combat game in the vein of Death Rally with intensive use of weapons. It features a story-mode (with 60 missions) including boss fights as well as local multiplayer and Xbox Live online matches for up to 4 players. Additional cars and weapons can be unlocked throughout the story mode by wrecking opponents. This adds their cars to the player's junkyard. From there the player can select up to four cars to put in a car pool. Cars can be customized aesthetically, but also technically through upgrades paid for with points earned throughout the races. Cars are divided in different classes based on their statistics and sometimes a specific class of car needs to be used for a race. It is possible to put a car back in the junkyard and exchange it for another one previously collected.\n\nTracks feature shortcuts and jumps, and power-ups such as nitro boosts, health, repairs, and extreme firepower. All of the cars have a standard weapon, such as a machinegun, rocket launcher, shotgun or energy ray, as well as melee weapons such as blades or weapons used to push other cars out of the way. There are 20 different vehicles to choose from. The different types of missions include regular races, elimination races, derbies, and small arenas similar to those of Destruction Derby. There are also tracks where the player needs to escort another vehicle or target a specific enemy in a race.\n\nThe game offers two ways of controlling the cars. First, a directional steering sending the car in the very direction the analog stick is pointed at, and secondly a traditional left/right steering as one can find it in regular racing games.",
