  "Overview": "Football Manager 2007 (also known as Worldwide Soccer Manager 2007 in North America) is a 2006 football management simulation game. Commonly known as FM2007, it is the third game in the Football Manager series overall, following Football Manager 2006. It was developed by Sports Interactive, and published by Sega. FM2007 was released for Windows, Mac, Appleâ€“Intel on 18 October 2006 with Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable versions following in December 2006. It was succeeded by Football Manager 2008.\n\nGameplay\nAs a result of user feedback and continued evolution of the game in general, Sports Interactive introduced over 100 new and revised features to Football Manager 2007. These include:\n\nA new default GUI, created with the input of user feedback. The new interface is said by SI to be more user-friendly.\nA revamped scouting engine, allowing for more realistic scouting of potential stars. including the ability for scouts to \"learn\" from their experience. A \"scout report card\" is also included, in order to provide easier access to important, detailed information about scouting targets.\nEnhanced media interaction, including the ability to make comments on any player in the game world. In previous versions featuring media commentary, managers could only comment on other managers.\nAn improved youth team system. The method for generating new players is completely revamped, with the older \"regen\" system - using recycled statistics from retired players - no longer in use.\nPre-match team talks. Previously, only half-time and full-time team talks could be given. SI also increased the half-time team talk functionality: managers can now target individual opposition players for special attention, such as instructing players to close them down or always to tackle them with force.\nA hints and tips screen appears when the game is being saved or loading is taking place.\nAn option to ask your own team's players what staff (e.g. coaches, physios) or players they would like you to bring to the club has been added.\nInteractions with the board are improved. The board can authorise the building of new stadia. Clubs can be taken over by a group of investors, who may opt to fire the manager (a player may get sacked in the process).\nThe manager, as well as NPCs, can comment on referees' decisions, which are not always correct.",
