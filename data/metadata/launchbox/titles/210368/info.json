  "Overview": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a beat 'em up game based on the 2012 television series developed by Nickelodeon. The game takes place in New York. The four turtles Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael are ambushed by Foot Soldiers. It turns out that the Foot Soldiers created a Mutagen bomb to mutate the whole city. The turtles eventually stop this treat, but a sudden call gets them on edge again. April O'Neil has been kidnapped by Shredder and he demands Splinter. The turtles fight their way through Foot Soldiers, Kraang, Baxter Stockman and his Mousers to be able to defeat Shredder and save April.\n\nJust like the original games it is a brawler game, but now in 3D. Many sequences use the classic side view, but there are also many other perspectives used. Each turtle has a specific attack and the four turtles are always on the screen. When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items. The collectibles in this game are Mutagen Canisters which are used to unlock extras.",
