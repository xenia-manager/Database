This series differs from many other episodic games in that players have a limited amount of time to make their decisions, and the choices they make have permanent, lasting effects. The final installment of the season, Episode 5 -- \"No Time Left\" finds the group's temporary lodging overrun by walkers, while Lee and a small band of survivors head off to find the missing Clementine.",
