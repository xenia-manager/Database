  "Overview": "The episodic experts at Telltale Games return, this time putting players in the middle of a zombie apocalypse based on the popular comic and television show The Walking Dead. This series differs from many other episodic games, in that players have a limited amount of time to make their decisions, and the choices they make have permanent, lasting effects. Episode 3 -- \"Long Road Ahead\" finds the unity of the survivors unraveling when internal betrayal and external attacks chase them from their Macon motor lodge, and they flee to the surmised safety of the coast.",
