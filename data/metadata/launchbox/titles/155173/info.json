  "Overview": "DLC Quest is a 2D platformer that mocks the use of downloadable content for commercial games as a barrier to access a full game experience. The player has to rescue a princess that has been kidnapped by a bad guy. At the start of the game however, many features are missing, such as sound, animation, or the ability to jump or move left. After collecting a number of coins these can be exchanged at a shopkeeper to buy DLC with the in-game currency.",
