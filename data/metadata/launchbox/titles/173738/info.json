  "Overview": "Sniper Elite V2 is a 2012 tactical shooter video game developed by Rebellion Developments and published by 505 Games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and later Wii U consoles and a developer self-published version for Microsoft Windows. It is a sequel/remake of Rebellion's 2005 game Sniper Elite that takes place in the same timeframe and location—the Battle of Berlin in April–May 1945—but with an altered narrative. The game's story follows an American Office of Strategic Services officer who must capture or eliminate the scientists involved in the German V-2 rocket program while the Red Army invades. A prequel named Sniper Elite III was released in 2014 for current and new-generation platforms.\n\nSniper Elite V2: Silver Star Edition features:\n\nAssassinate The Fuhrer DLC plus 2 weapons\nMultiplayer Expansion DLC\nWeapons Pack DLC – plus 3 weapons. M1 Carbine (US Rifle) - Widely used throughout the US military, the M1 Carbine has an improved rate of fire and holds 15 rounds. High recoil and a lower level of zoom are its weaknesses. MP44 (German SMG) - High rate of fire and further effective range make the MP44 superior to the MP40. However, slightly less damage output should be a consideration. Webley Mk6 Revolver (British Pistol) - A classic British revolver. High power coupled with a lower rate of fire gives this 6 shooter a very distinctive feel.\nThe Neudorf Outpost DLC is a brand new Sniper Elite V2 single-player mission. Use your guile to carry out the demolition of a heavily defended German fuel dump in the Harz Mountains. Players will have to plan and meticulously execute their approach in this large, open environment. Also includes 3 new weapons – the Type 99 Rifle, the Blyskawica Sub-machinegun and the Tokarev TT33 Pistol.\nThe Saint Pierre DLC is a new Sniper Elite V2 single-player mission. Players will find themselves deployed in a small village in France, where they must intercept an influential German commander. The interconnected streets offer many tactical opportunities, but the many German opposition will provide a stern test. Also includes 2 new weapons – the M1D Garand Rifle and the Lee Enfield No 3 Rifle.",
