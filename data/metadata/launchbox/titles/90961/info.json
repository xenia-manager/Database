  "Overview": "Rorschach's Journal: November, 5, 1971, I wish the scum of the earth had one throat and I had my hands around it. I was investigating a jailbreak with Nite Owl. It seems Underboss is behind it. We put him away in '66. Time to go to work. This city is afraid of me, I've seen it's true face. \n\nBased on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel, and the recent film adaptation, from Warner Brothers. Watchmen: The End Is Nigh, is set 10 years before the events of the novel. And just before the Keene Act is passed making costumed vigilantes illegal.\n\nPlaying as either Rorschach, or Nite Owl II. The Watchmen are investigating a prison break. The plot thickens when they discover that an old foe, Underboss, is behind the break. But in the world of Watchmen, nothing is as it seems, and there may be bigger stakes involved.\n\nThe game plays like a brawler, like Streets Of Rage. And sports a fairly deep combat system. With counters and throws to master, and many moves to unlock. And each playable character has a unique style and moves.\n\nThe game is divided into six chapters. And can be played alone with the A.I. controlling the other hero. Or Co-Op on the same screen. \n\nJackie Earle Haley and Patrick Wilson reprise their roles as Rorschach and Nite Owl II respectively.",
