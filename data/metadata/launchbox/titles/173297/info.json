The game introduces two new circuits: Spielberg (Austrian GP) and the Sochi Autodrom (Russian GP), as well as the return of the Hockenheimring as the German GP circuit of choice, and the Bahrain International Circuit featuring a night race for the first time. The new Driver Evaluation System configures the game's difficulty after analyzing one lap driven by the player. The handling and physics have been improved, and the Career and Scenario modes have been expanded.",
