  "Overview": "MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM OPERATION: TROY is a third/first-person shooter for the Xbox 360 that is based on the anime series Gundam. The game features combat in mobile suits, on foot and in vehicles (much like Battlefield series of games.), as well as online play. As the title suggests, the game is set during the One Year War and will feature many of the iconic mecha from that era. Mobile Ops: The One Year War was also planned to be released in North America, but as the game was never released, and there has been no official word from Namco Bandai Games on the subject since the initial announcement, it is assumed that these plans were quietly cancelled.",
