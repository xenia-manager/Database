  "Overview": "The world's leading music game meets the greatest band in history. The Beatles: Rock Band gives fans what they've been waiting for: a chance to experience the Beatles' legendary story from the inside. In The Beatles: Rock Band you won't just watch and listen as The Beatles make rock history, create landmark records and conquer the world-for the first time, you'll be part of the band. The Beatles software is compatible with Rock Band, Guitar Hero and most other instrument controllers. \n\nJoin John, Paul, George, and Ringo on-stage at legendary shows, behind closed doors in the recording studio, and in dreamscapes that bring the psychedelic imagery of the latter stage of their career to life. The acclaimed Rock Band elements of interactive play and full-band capacity are here as well, but with brand-new additions. One of these is full three-part harmonies, which challenge you to recreate The Beatles’ vocal blend - a first for any music game and facilitated by the game's support for up to three microphone controllers. In addition, the game supports custom-built controllers modeled after the actual instruments that the Fab Four played, and eventually helped to make iconic, audio straight from the masters, and graphics that take you on a magical tour through the key moments in The Beatles history. Produced with the full cooperation of The Beatles and Apple Corps, the game is packed with hidden fab extras that will push you and up to five of your friends to master the songs both online and offline in order to hear rare audio and view unseen photos from the archives. \n\nThe Beatles were one of the most prolific bands of all time, churning out memorable hit after hit and this is reflected in the song list of The Beatles: Rock Band. From \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" to \"Get Back,\" every song in The Beatles: Rock Band comes directly from the Abbey Road master tapes. More than 40 songs are included with the game, spanning the length of The Beatles’ career, with more to follow via download.",
