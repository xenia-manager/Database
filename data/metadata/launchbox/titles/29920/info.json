  "Overview": "The follow-up to Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnovâ€™s Hexic, Hexic 2 expands the formula with a new multiplayer mode and new special pieces. The gameplay has remained the same; Spin a trio of hexes to create a cluster of three or more pieces of same color. If you manage to create some of the more advanced formations, you create a special piece with different abilities. Like before, formations made out of these special pieces lead to the biggest scores, so mastering them is vital for reaching high-scores. \n\nThere are various gameplay options, ranging from easy-going and relaxed puzzle solving to more hectic races against clock or an opponent. Hexic 2 also sports a new 3-D presentation with plenty of eye-candy as well as soothing electronic soundtrack.",
