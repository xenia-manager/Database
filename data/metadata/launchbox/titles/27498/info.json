  "Overview": "The Golden Compass is a 2007 action-adventure game developed for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360 and PC by Shiny Entertainment, and for the Nintendo DS by A2M. The game was published on all platforms by Sega.\n\nReleased in Europe in November 2007, and in North America and Australia in December, the game is based on both the film of the same name, and the novel upon which the film is based, Northern Lights by Philip Pullman. The game was released prior to the film and features a slightly different sequence of events towards the end of the story, as well as additional footage at the end of the game not seen in the film. This was due to a last minute re-edit of the last half hour of the film by New Line Cinema that couldn't be incorporated into the game, which was based on the shooting script.[1] The Golden Compass was the last game developed by Shiny before Foundation 9 Entertainment merged them with The Collective.[2]\n\nThe game received negative reviews across every platform, although it sold well.",
