  "Overview": "Disney Infinity 2.0 is the successor to Disney Infinity and it introduces the second generation of the concept as an entirely new game. Just like the original game it is an action-adventure where players place physical figurines on the infinity base with a USB connection to the system and they are then introduced as characters in the game. The characters level up as they are used and progress is stored in the character itself, meaning they can level up further using them on a different system or on a different location. The figurines that can be purchased are platform independent. There are two large groups of characters: Marvel Super Heroes and Disney Originals.\n\nAs in the first game it is split up into two game modes. The story part of the game (Play Set mode) is enabled through a play set that resembles a crystal figurine placed on the base. Infinity 2.0 supports multiple, self-contained story modes based on the purchased play sets. The core gameplay is a traditional action platformer. Characters are guided through the game world and have different types of moves. Some characters excel at melee combat, while others rely on ranged attacks. As the characters level up new abilities and attributes become available, assigned through a skill tree. Skills levels can be reset at level 10 and 20 to try different paths. Some characters have special abilities such as flight (Iron Man) or web-swinging (Spider-Man).",
