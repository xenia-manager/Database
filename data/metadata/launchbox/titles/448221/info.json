  "Overview": "Every Party (エブリパーティ, Ebiri Paati) is a party video game developed by Game Republic and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was a Japanese launch title for the Xbox 360.\n\nThe game plays as a board game in which up to four players compete to be the first to reach a goal. Each board features multiple routes, with some being shorter and riskier, while others are longer but potentially more lucrative in terms of prizes. There are a number (30+) of different mini games which can be triggered during play, similar to the Mario Party series.",
