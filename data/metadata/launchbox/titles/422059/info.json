  "Overview": "The $1 Zombie Game is a third-person wave shooter in which the player fights against zombies. During each wave, the player receives two new weapons: a big one (e.g. machine gun, shotgun or sniper rifle) and a pistol with unlimited ammo. The weapon can be zoomed in which allows for more precise aim movements (when zooming a sniper rifle, the game changes to a first person view).\n\nThe goal is simply to kill all zombies before they manage to drain the player's health with their touch. Fortunately a health pack is included in the starting gear (and more are gained over the course of the game) which restores a part of the overall health. Over time the zombies become more numerous and take more damage.",
