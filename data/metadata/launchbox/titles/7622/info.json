  "Overview": "Star Trek Legacy begins a few years after the end of the TV-series Star Trek Enterprise. Starfleet is growing fast and new technologies have been introduced like the tractor beam or starbases. You take the helm of the starship Enterprise NX-01 which has been heavily upgraded with all the cutting edge technology and your mission is to find a missing Vulcan ship. During the campaign you play get the chance to play all the great ships from the five series up to the USS Voyager under the command of Captain Janeway. All five captains (Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway) are voiced by their actors from the TV-series.\n\nYou control your ship either directly with the keyboard or by giving orders to your helm on a map of the current sector or by marking planets or enemies in directly on the screen. Depending on how good you solved a mission, you earn command points with which you can buy up to 4 ships. They function like a squad. You can either give them individual commands like defend this position or take the lead and tell them to do, what you do. If you aren't satisfied with the actions of your individual ships, you can take over the helm yourself at any time.\n\nDuring the campaign you only take control over ships of the United Federation of Planets and fight against Klingons, Romulans and the Borg. But in skirmish as well as in multiplayer, you can take either side yourself and fight against up to 4 other players or together against a common threat in coop in which each player takes control over one ship of the squad.\n\nAlso there's much fighting with enemy ships, your mission goals include escorting medical ships to poisoned planets or defending planets against incoming asteroids.",
