  "ReleaseDate": "2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00",
  "Overview": "Ultra Street Fighter 4 includes Edition Select, which lets you pick from the various versions of the characters from all the games released in the Street Fighter 4 series.\n\nAt character select, you can pick the version of the fighter from SF4, SSF4, SSF4AE, SSF4 AE Ver. 2012 and Ultra Street Fighter 4.\n\nThis means, of course, that vanilla Sagat, who was nerfed by later versions of the game, can go up against the rebalanced characters from Ultra.\n\n\"In all the years that I've been playing through the SF4 series, I can't count how many times discussions on 'who the strongest character has been thus far' have come up among players both old and new,\" Capcom's Peter Rosas, himself a former tournament player, wrote on Capcom Unity.\n\n\"Seeing of how there was no actual way to measure whether vanilla SF4 Sagat was stronger than AE Yun, players would engage in long theoretical discussions with no way to figure out who was right. Well, time to change that in Ultra SF!\"\n\nThere are a couple of ways to get Ultra, due out in June on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in August on PC.\n\nIf you have Super Street Fighter 4 or Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition you can download Ultra Street Fighter 4 as a £10.99 / €14.99 / $14.99 digital upgrade for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in early June. The PC digital upgrade and the PC full digital bundle will both be available in August 2014.\n\nAlso in August the PS3 and Xbox 360 retail versions and full download version of the game will be released for £29.99 / €39.99 / $39.99. If you buy the PS3 or Xbox 360 retail version, or PS3, Xbox 360 or PC full digital bundle you get all previously-released costumes for the series.",
