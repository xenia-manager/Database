  "Overview": "Amniotic is a top down, twin-stick shooter in which the player takes control of a cell in the human body and fights off various germs and diseases that are attacking an amniotic cell. Defeated enemies will drop glowing rings that act as health for the player, repairing any damage they have taken. During the game, the player's cell can also be upgraded using these rings to unlock better weaponry to help in the fight against the infection. \n\nThere is also a two player co-op game mode available to play on a single console.",
