  "Overview": "Comic book super hero Captain Smiley and his sidekick Star are down on their luck. The last issue of the comic book \"The Adventures of Captain Smiley\" totally failed and both heroes (as well as the rest of the cast from the comic book) are out of a job. Luckily, the nice people at Twisted Pixel Games notice this and in a fourth wall breaking move they provide them with a temporary base of operations in which Smiley and his friends (and enemies) can stay until they can afford to pay off the loans and re-issue the comic book once again. \n\nIn order to make enough money, Captain Smiley's assistant Gerda is sent side jobs in other comics which Captain Smiley has to take (for a cash payment up front of course!). The game takes place over several genres of comics (aside from the modern style of Smiley's own comic), and the graphical style and villains all adhere to the comic in which they appear. Captain Smiley will face off against such enemies as tribal villagers, sexist security guards, and cuddly manga animals... all in the name of making his name famous once again!",
