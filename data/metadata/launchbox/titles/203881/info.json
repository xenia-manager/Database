  "Overview": "Beyond Good & Evil, Outland, From Dust Triple Pack\n\nBeyond Good & Evil Play as Jade, a young investigative reporter, and expose a terrible government conspiracy. Wary of her government's promises to repel the aliens for good, she sets out to capture the truth behind the prolonged war. Armed with a camera, a dai-jo staff, and fierce determination, it's your job to save your planet and its inhabitants. \n\nFrom Dust is the latest original game concept by Eric Chahi, creator of the cult classic, \"Another World / Out of this World\". Immerse yourself in a world as exotically beautiful as it is dangerous! You control the destiny of a primitive tribe against the backdrop of a world in constant evolution-a universe where mighty Nature reclaims what is hers; and your mastery of the elements is your people's only chance of survival. \n\nOutland In the middle of Balance and Chaos, now stands one man whose efforts may bridge the ancient divide, or doom the world to destruction. The award-winning studio Housemarque, maker of Super Stardust HD, has teamed up with Ubisoft to create an ambitious platformer inspired by epic adventures such as the Prince of Persia series. Each player's adventure will take him between light and darkness and force him to adapt to an ever-changing world.",
