  "Overview": "Linear Bounded Phenogram is a visual novel[1] in which the player advances through text and dialogue to read through several short stories; unlike previous entries in the Steins;Gate series, which let the player affect the flow of the story by sending specific messages from the protagonist's phone, the plot of the individual chapters in Steins;Gate: Linear Bounded Phenogram is not influenced by player input, barring the exchange of different e-mail messages with other characters. In the iPhone version of the game, the player picks up and puts down the in-game phone by holding the phone they are playing on vertically or horizontally, respectively.",
