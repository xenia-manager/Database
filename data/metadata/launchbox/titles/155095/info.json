  "Overview": "Sister Angelika is not your average nun: she has purple hair, carries a large gun and a larger scythe, and spends her days fighting zombies. The town of Jalombe is under attack by such zombies, and she has been summoned to help exterminate them. Together with Father Richiardo at the monastery, she must find and destroy the source of the outbreak before Jalombe is destroyed. \n\nTwin Blades is a scrolling action game where the player must slaughter waves of zombies as they spring up from the ground, using both a variety of different guns and a very large scythe. Killing zombies nets the player zombie hearts, which can be exchanged at the monastery for weapon and power upgrades, including new guns, more health, and even new moves. There are several types of zombies, some of which are resistant to certain attacks, and every so often a much larger, more difficult boss creature will appear. \n\nThe player can freely travel between open areas, and as stages are played, night will fall, which will cause zombie swarms on other stages to replenish and strengthen. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a survival mode where the player must survive 31 days against endless swarms of zombies.",
