  "Overview": "Syberia is a graphic adventure game, developed and published by Microïds, and released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox on 9 January 2002, with the game later ported for Windows Mobile, Nintendo DS, Android, OS X, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, iOS, and Nintendo Switch in later years. The game follows Kate Walker, an American lawyer tasked with overseeing the major sale of a company and her subsequent journey across Europe and Russia to find the brother of the recently deceased owner. Alongside the main plot, the story also consists of a subplot involving Kate's personal life.\n\nSyberia was a commercial success, with sales above 500,000 units worldwide by 2005. It was acclaimed by critics for its intelligent script and use of graphic design that encompassed elements of art nouveau and clockpunk fiction. Its success led to it being followed by two major sequels - Syberia II, released on 30 March 2004, and Syberia 3, released on 20 April 2017.\n\nOn 19 August 2019, it was announced that a fourth game had already been in production for 18 months and was to be titled Syberia: The World Before.\n\nSyberia is a third-person, mouse-driven, semi-realistic/semi-surrealistic adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the story line to proceed. As a purely graphical adventure game, Syberia follows the guidelines introduced by Broken Sword.",
