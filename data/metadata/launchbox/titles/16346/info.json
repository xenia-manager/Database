  "Overview": "Risk: Factions is a downloadable video game for Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service (discontinued as of 2014),[2] PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network, and Windows computers through Steam. The game was announced on January 12, 2010 for Xbox 360,[3] December 21, 2010 for PlayStation 3,[4] and March 8, 2011 for Windows.[5] It is based on Hasbro's popular board game, Risk. The game has both single player and online modes of play.[6] The single player campaign is divided into 5 chapters. Each chapter unlocks one of the game's five factions. The gameplay in the single player campaign is similar to that of the 2008 Risk rule set. Players must complete three objectives and have control of their capital to win the game. Alternatively, a player may defeat all the opponents to win the game as well.\n\nThe features added to RISK: Factions that do not appear in the 2008 rule set are overkills and terrain features. Overkills are awarded when players roll either two or three sixes. If a player rolls two sixes, he destroys twice as many units as he would normally. If a player rolls three sixes, he destroys all the opponent's units in the current battle.\n\nSome maps also have special terrain features like the volcano, which can erupt and kill most surrounding soldiers, or the temple, which allows a player who has captured it to convert another country of his choice and all units within it to his color.",
