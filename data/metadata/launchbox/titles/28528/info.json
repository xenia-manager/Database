  "Overview": "Fighters Uncaged is a single-player-only fighting game controlled using the Kinect, a motion sensing input device. The player controls the protagonist of the game, Simon, through his attempts to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord.[1] The game features one gamemode called \"Fight\" which is only accessible after completing the tutorial.[2] Fighters Uncaged is played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the opponent being on the opposite side.[2] Simon is able to do a range of different actions, including short and long punches, kicks, blocks, dodges, and headbutts.[1] The player can execute special moves via shouting in the direction of the Kinect, once the corresponding bar is full.[3] Fighting consists of looking for telegraphs in the movements of one's opponents to figure out when to dodge or block attacks, then hitting them while they are vulnerable. In the early stages of Fighters Uncaged, it is made less difficult to read the telegraphs of the opponent, but as the player progresses, they become increasingly imperceptible. The moves Simon can complete depend on where the opponent is at the time, and therefore only certain moves will land hits at particular moments.[1] Fighters Uncaged features different leagues, with higher leagues being reached by having a certain number of points. Points are obtained by defeating the opponent, while having a good score. Good scores are attained by accomplishing counter attacks, exploiting the enemies' weak spots, and correctly completing combos. If a good score is not secured at the end of the fight, no points are rewarded",
