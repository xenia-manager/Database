  "Overview": "Shrek Forever After: The Final Chapter is based on the film of the same name, taking place after Shrek the Third. Shrek and Fiona are now living the domestic life with their triplets and Shrek is making a living signing pitchforks at Fiona's behest instead of going around scaring people. This does not make Shrek feel like much of an ogre, so the mischievous Rumpelstiltskin offers him a pact that will make him feel like a ogre again. All of a sudden, Shrek finds himself in an alternate reality of Far, Far Away where he and Fiona never met, ogres are hunted and Rumpelstiltskin is king!\n\nGameplay is similar to the previous Shrek movie adaptations, you will go around finding items and solving puzzles in order to progress. As you progress, you can upgrade your character's skill sets that can be used in subsequent playthroughs, as well as unlock additional skills. You will also earn coins as you go along, which can be used to buy items in game as well as buying hints and information from NPCs. During combat, you will be able to string together combo attacks once you have filled up enough of your on screen combo counter. It also features two realities that you can play in, one which is Shrek's 'normal' reality and the one that forms as a result of his deal with Rumpelstiltskin.\n\nThere is also a four player co-op mode available for up to four people who can play as Fiona, Donkey, or Puss in Boots.",
