  "Overview": "Your mama told you not to go around breaking hearts. But in Hardwood Hearts, that’s what it’s all about! Try to take as few points as possible… unless you want to shoot the moon. If you take all the points in a moon shot, the points go to your opponents! Up the stakes even more with Spot Hearts, where heart cards are worth their face values, the queen of spades is worth 50, and a moon shot earns your foes a whopping 150 points! And don’t forget to congratulate your friends--or irritate your opponents--with a clever foom!",
