  "Overview": "Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure is a motion-controlled action game that features the characters and settings from five of the studio's computer-animated feature films. Younger players take the roles of favorite characters such as Buzz Lightyear or Lightning McQueen, to take part in mini-games based on Toy Story, Cars, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and Up. Hands-free motion controls call on players to hop, stretch, and wave arms and legs, to guide their characters through platform jumping, hang gliding, swimming, 3D racing, and other fast-paced activities.",
