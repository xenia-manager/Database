  "Overview": "Experience the hauntingly beautiful world of LIMBO, and take a journey of exploration with a boy uncertain of his sister's fate, or in fact, his own. \n\nLIMBO is single player 2D Puzzle-Platformer created entirely in black and white. The game is centered around a mechanic known as \"Trial by Death\" in which the player must die in order to discover the solutions to the puzzles set before him. In the event of this, the player spawns at the last save point and must use what he has learned if he hopes to find his sister and get closure on the events set before him.",
