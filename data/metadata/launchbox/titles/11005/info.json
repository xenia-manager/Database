  "Overview": "Master strategy in the medieval world! In the classic board game Carcassonne, the medieval countryside thrives as you and your opponents place tiles and complete towns, roads, and farms while competing to amass the most points. Own the largest towns, longest roads, and biggest farms. \n\nCarcassonne is a turn-based strategy game for 2 to 5 players based on the German board game of the same name. By playing land tiles one by one, players build up a landscape of cities, roads, farms, and monasteries. Players compete to claim control of the features they build with a limited supply of follower pieces. Judging where to play the tiles and when to use a follower or not is a deceptively simple process - yet the depth of the game stems from judging when and where to use the followers to gain the most points.",
