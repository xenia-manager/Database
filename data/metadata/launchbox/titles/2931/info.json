  "Overview": "Rayman Raving Rabbids, known in French as Rayman contre les Lapins Cr√©tins (literally meaning \"Rayman against the Moronic Rabbits\"), is a spinoff in the Rayman series released by the company Ubisoft as a Wii launch title. The game consists of 75 minigames. The game is primarily designed with the Wii Remote in mind, but is also available on Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, and Xbox 360. Releases for PlayStation 3 and PSP of the game were planned, but were later cancelled for unknown reasons, making it the only game in the series that was released for the PlayStation 2.\n\nUbisoft released a sequel to the game, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, in November 2007, and released the third game in the series, Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party, in November 2008. The fourth game in the series, Rabbids Go Home, was released in 2009, though only on the Wii and DS systems and a fifth game, Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time, was released in 2010. A sixth game, Raving Rabbids: Alive & Kicking, was released in 2011 only for Xbox 360 (which requires Kinect) and the seventh game, Rabbids Land, was released as a Wii U exclusive game on November 2012. As of April 2014, the series had sold over 14 million units worldwide.[1]",
