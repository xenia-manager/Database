  "Overview": "Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast and Furious is a standalone expansion to Forza Horizon 2 to promote the 2015 movie Furious 7. It is an arcade open world racing game. similarly to the original Forza Horizon 2.\n\nThe game takes place in the same environment known from Forza Horizon 2, but decreased in scale - about one third of the roads and locations from the main game are available to the player. The objective of the game is to obtain ten cars from the movie Furious 7. This is accomplished via participation in various races and other events. The game exhibits many elements known from the core Forza Horizon franchise: the player can participate in circuit races, point-to-point races, showcase events (where he must win against non-standard competitors, like an attack helicopter), speed traps and speedzones, bounty boards and additional challenges known as the bucket list. Many of the features however have been cut - there are no experience points and perks, obtainable cars are limited to the vehicles from the movie cars the player can obtain in his garage (though there are some other cars that are drivable in certain events), and unlike Forza Horizon 2 players cannot paint, upgrade, sell or tune the vehicles.\n\nGraphically each version uses a different engine. Differences are notable in draw distance, density of foliage, shadows, rendering and lighting. While both versions have a day-night cycle like the original game, Xbox One introduces more varied weather conditions with atmospheric effects. Any route is basically the same on both versions, but the Xbox One version has more traffic and more variation in the environmental design. Even though sharing the same game world, the events and circuits differ slightly.",
