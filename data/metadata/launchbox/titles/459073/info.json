  "Overview": "Samurai Warriors 2: Xtreme Legends (戦国無双2: 猛将伝 Sengoku Musō 2: Mōshōden) was first released on August 23, 2007, in Japan for the PlayStation 2. It is the fifth Xtreme Legends expansion by Koei, and also the first (and only) Xtreme Legends expansion since Dynasty Warriors 4: Xtreme Legends to be released after Samurai Warriors 2: Empires (other Xtreme Legends expansions are released shortly after the release of the original game). It shares the same achievements with the parent game on the Xbox 360. The expansion introduced new characters to the series, including Toshiie Maeda, Gracia and Motochika Chosokabe. Yoshimoto Imagawa from Samurai Warriors: Xtreme Legends returned in the expansion with an updated character design, Katsuie Shibata and Kojirō Sasaki from Samurai Warriors 2: Empires are also playable and have new weapons. Katsuie Shibata wields two hand axes, while Kojirō Sasaki still carries a nodachi, but can now summon an ex-dimensional sword during battle. Because Yoshimoto Imagawa was put back into the game, the previously omitted battle of Okehazama is brought back, and Hideyoshi's Shikoku campaign against Motochika Chosokabe is also included.",
