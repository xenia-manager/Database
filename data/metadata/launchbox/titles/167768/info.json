  "Overview": "Onechanbara Z: Kagura puts players in control of the Vampiric half-sisters Kagura and Saaya. Unlike previous entries, the game plays akin to a modern hack and slash game, featuring a freely controllable camera, dash controls, and separate jump and dodge buttons. The combat system has been expanded upon from previous games to make possible freely chain-able combos and air juggling, allowing for stylish combo action that is similar to (but still simpler than) the combo systems of Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.\n\nThe game's story mode is divided into chapters, each serving as a short stage. Player progress will be halted at certain points in the chapter by blocked off pathways, indicating to players that they must clear the area of enemies before proceeding. After each of these segments, the player will be graded based on combat performance, with the highest rank being a V rank. At the end of each chapter, the player's overall chapter performance will be determined by the ranks they received from the earlier combat segments, similarly to Bayonetta. Platinum is the highest grade the player can receive, and the higher the chapter grade the player receives, the more Yellow Orbs that are earned. Yellows Orbs in this entry do not serve as experience points, but as currency towards the in-game shop, where players are able to purchase consumables as well as new weapons and moves.",
