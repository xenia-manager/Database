  "Overview": "GoldenEye 007: Reloaded is a modern reworking of the classic N64 GoldenEye game. These Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions are essentially enhanced versions of the 2010 GoldenEye 007 Wii remake, but with a new game engine and added features.\n\nNext to enhancements already introduced in the Wii version, there are numerous changes over the 2010 release. The basic multiplayer was for instance extended with friends lists, leaderboards, and player invites. Besides the engine change, the graphics have been overhauled, and are typically high-definition revamps. A major addition to is a new single player mode called MI6 OPS. It features leaderboards and a large list of mission modifiers, including numbers of enemies, enemy and player health, rocket launchers, Golden Gun, enemy aggressiveness, etc. Players have a variety of single-person challenges ranked on a system of one to four stars depending on modifiers and player performance. There are four different styles of MI6 OPS objectives:\n\n    Assault - The player must fight and survive through an area to reach an extraction point.\n    Defense - The player downloads information from computer consoles, and must protect them from swarms of enemies.\n    Elimination - Defeat set numbers of enemies (number chosen by the player).\n    Stealth - Move through a level without alerting enemies.\n\nGoldenEye 007: Reloaded features local online split-screen (an homage to the original N64 Goldeneye) for up to four players, as well online multiplayer. There are numerous modes such as Golden Gun where the popular one-shot kill weapon is highlighted, You Only Live Twice where players have limited lives, and Detonator Agent which is a version of the classic kid's game Hot Potato, with bombs in place of potatoes, among others. Some modes are only available online, such as Heroes where one player on a team is stronger, faster, and deadlier than others or GoldenEye where teams fight over control of the GoldenEye satellite.\n\nLike the MI6 OPS mode, there are over a dozen modifiers that can be applied to matches, such as editing the radar or shutting it off completely, requiring headshots for successful kills, limiting score or lives, making grenades bouncy or sticky, preventing players from standing still for longer than three seconds and s",
