  "Overview": "Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate (abbreviated to DOA5 Ultimate or just DOA5U) is a fighting game in the Dead or Alive series, developed by Team Ninja in partnership with Sega AM2, and released by Koei Tecmo for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013. It was followed by an arcade edition later in 2013. It marks the first game in the series to use the \"Ultimate\" name since Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, as well as the first arcade game to be released by Tecmo Koei since Dead or Alive 2 Millenium in 2000.\n\nDOA5 Ultimate is an expanded edition of 2012's Dead or Alive 5, incorporating some features from the PlayStation Vita's Dead or Alive 5 Plus as well as additional content, including five characters that are new or returning to the series (including two Ninja Gaiden characters), as well as gameplay system tweaks and expansions, many of them in the online multiplayer tag team mode (including an introduction of two-on-two tag team battles). The game received generally favorable reviews.\n\nA free-to-play cut version of DOA5 Ultimate, titled Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Core Fighters, was released on the PlayStation Store alongside the retail game. The arcade edition Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate: Arcade was released on 24 December 2013, distributed by Sega. Ultimate was followed by Dead or Alive 5 Last Round in 2015.",
