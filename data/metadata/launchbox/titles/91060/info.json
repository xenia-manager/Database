  "Overview": "Outpost Kaloki X is the Xbox 360 Live Arcade version of the humorous space station tycoon game Outpost Kaloki. You manage an interstellar space station with various ports that can be equipped for space travellers, constantly balancing operating costs against revenue. You can focus on entertainment, commercial activities or science, but you also have to construct buildings, provide enough power and repair all your structures. Every port can be micromanaged for content and price, and you can upgrade to new expansions and sell the old ones. At the same time, you have to keep an eye out for alien attacks or asteroids.\n\nThere are two story modes: Adventure and War, with goals for each mission, based on shielding off attacks, constructing buildings or getting revenues. There are seven races and 50 space stations to play with. Like most tycoon games, there is also a sandbox mode where you can play without objectives or restrictions. Soon after the release, additional scenarios and picture packs were made available.",
