  "Overview": "Lumines Live! is the Xbox Live Arcade version of the popular PSP launch title, Lumines: Puzzle Fusion. The basic idea of the game is to shift and align 2x2 squares of colored tiles into a wide bin. When you create a square or rectangle 2x2 or larger of the same color, the panels will highlight. Any highlighted panels are cleared by a constantly sweeping line that passes from left to right across the game area. Clearing multiple panels in one sweep will earn you bonuses, but it will be game over if you reach the top of the bin and try to place another square on top.\n\nDuring gameplay, the music will play according to the moves you make; such as square rotation, dropping squares, clearing tiles, and more. This gives the illusion of a blend of music and gameplay. Lumines Live! includes several different modes of play - some from the original Lumines, some new. Familiar modes include:\nChallenge Mode: Play an endless game, earning new skins as you progress.\n\nSkin Edit Mode: Play a short or endless game, choosing from one (or more) of your favorite previously unlocked skins from Challenge Mode.\n\nVS CPU Mode: Face off against the CPU in trying to claim the most play area.\n\nTime Attack Mode: Try to clear the most tiles in a set period of time.\n\nPuzzle Mode: Try to make specified shapes using the provided tiles.\nNew to Lumines Live! is Mission Mode. In this mode, you must clear all the tiles using the provided squares in a set period of time, much like the Puzzle Mode of Tetris Attack. Players can also compete against a friend either locally or on Xbox Live in VS Mode. Additional stages for Mission, VS CPU, and Puzzle Modes can be purchased from Xbox Live Marketplace, as well as extra skins for the game.",
