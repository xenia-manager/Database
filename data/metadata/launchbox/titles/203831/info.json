  "Overview": "Crash Time III is the seventh main game in the long-running German Alarm für Cobra 11 series. It is based on the German action police series of the same name that first aired in 1996. In this driving game players control a car with detectives Semir Gerkan, one of the original characters, and Ben Jäger who was first introduced in the TV series in the 24th season in September 2008.\n\nThe game is set in a large, living city that can be freely explored. The main career mode is centered around a terrorist attack on an international airport. Initially starting seven days before those events, Gerkan and Jäger drive around performing patrol duties until they get involved with the gangsters behind the attacks. Most of the missions are centered around tasks such as tailing, stopping and shooting suspects, escort missions and reaching destinations in time (including getting breakfast). Most of the missions have a time limit that can be extended a few times, but at the loss of star ratings that open up new options in the game.\n\nThere is a wide selection of cars that can be unlocked gradually, with different categories such as American Cobra, Cobra Special, Transporter, Road Chief, Race Car and Police Car. There are about 40 vehicles and they are rated based on top speed, acceleration and handling. Cars take damage and the detectives also need to pay for damage inflicted to property or other vehicles. Using the siren or the horn, the traffic will adjust its behaviour. While driving, a large arrow shows the general direction of the objective and the remaining distance. There is also a top-down road map that can be consulted. There are different precincts and many distinctive areas and buildings such as the airport, the highway, hotels, churches, hospitals and a harbour. All cars have a nitro option for additional speed, with a recharge time.\n\nNext to the main career mode, there is also an option to do races against other cars and a split-screen multiplayer mode on a single computer for up to four players.",
