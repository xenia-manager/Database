  "Overview": "Just Dance 2015 is dance video game developed by Ubisoft Paris and Ubisoft Milan and published by Ubisoft. The sixth main installment in the franchise, it was officially announced at Ubisoft's E3 2014 press event on 9 June 2014 alongside Just Dance Nowâ€”a web-based spin-off of the franchise. It was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, and Wii U on 21 October 2014 in North America, 23 October in Europe, 24 October in the UK and 25 October in Asia.[1] A sequel, Just Dance 2016 was released in October 2015.\n\n2015 introduced additional social networking features to the series, including the ability for players to challenge other players online, and submit clips of themselves playing for inclusion into compilation videos featured in-game. The game also added the ability for a smartphone to be used as a controller with a companion app.\n\nJust Dance 2015 received mostly positive reviews by critics, praising the franchise's continued focus on a casual audience through its forgiving motion detection, multiplayer functionality, and pop-oriented soundtrack, although criticism was directed at the soundtrack for focusing too much on teen pop, as well as its user interface for having confusing and irregular conventions. As of December 31, 2014, over 5 million copies have been shipped worldwide.[2]",
