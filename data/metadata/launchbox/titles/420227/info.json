  "Overview": "Akane the Kunoichi is an 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls the ninja Akane. She is secretly in love with her samurai master Goro. One day he is kidnapped by Hiromi and her ninja minions. You need to rescue him by completing fifteen levels and defeating five bosses.\n\nAkane can move around and jump. She can also cling to walls and use that position to wall jump. She attacks enemies by throwing a knife with an endless supply. By default a single one is thrown, but through power-ups the weapon can be upgraded, to throw three or five at once, also in a diagonal direction. When hit, a heart is lost and the weapon is downgraded. By collecting scrolls she can use three different ninjitsu techniques that provide a powerful attack. Levels have a time limit and time can be extended by locating hourglass items. Enemies include ninjas, huge creatures and animals such as dogs. She has four hearts that act as lives and when they are gone the entire level needs to be restarted. Optionally three charming lost kimonos can be found in each level. Levels are grouped by three and each group has a different theme with a boss at the end.",
