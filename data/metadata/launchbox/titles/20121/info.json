It was developed by Irrational Games, and published by 2K Games. It is available on Linux, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and OS X. Burial at Sea consists of two episodes.

Whereas Infinite took place aboard Columbia, the floating air city set in 1912, Burial at Sea takes place in an alternate reality within the underwater city of Rapture, a year before the events of the first BioShock game (which is set in 1960). The game features Booker DeWitt as a private detective, and Elizabeth as a femme fatale who employs Booker's services",
