  "Overview": "SkyDrift is a 2011 airplane racing video game developed by Digital Reality. It was self-published by the developer on the Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 platforms. The Xbox 360 version was published by Namco Bandai Partners. It was released on September 6, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, September 7, 2011 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade, and for Microsoft Windows on November 21, 2011.\n\nThe game features multiple game modes which are primarily focused on combat racing. Two downloadable content packs have been released which add additional planes and two new game modes. The game was well received, with aggregate scores ranging in the mid-to-high 70% range. Critics generally felt that the gameplay was strong, that the controls were responsive, and that the online multiplayer was excellent, though multiple reviewers cited disappointment in the lack of any local multiplayer.",
