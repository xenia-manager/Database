  "Overview": "Hasbro Family Game Night 3 is the third installment in the board game-to-video game franchise by Hasbro and EA.\n\nAll of the games are more or less true to their board game counterpart, usually having some added mini games or interactive parts not found in the originals. All games can be played in either the Original version or a game mode called Remix, which adds new rules, switches gameplay mechanics, or simply makes it into more or less a new game entirely. There is also the option of playing a full game or a quick game for each of the five games (which either is made up of a much simplified board or fewer rounds than the full version).\n\nThe game hub is an amusement park, where all the games are seen as rides or buildings and where the players pick which game they want to play. There is also the option of changing outfits for Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (who can be seen wandering around the park). After a certain number of games have been played, mascots, confetti, statues and various items are unlocked for the amusement park. They fill no other function than adding visual flair to the hub.",
