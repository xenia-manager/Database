  "Overview": "Deadliest Catch: Sea of Chaos is a game based on the TV series Deadliest Catch in which the player is a captain of a ship fishing on the Bering Sea. In the Campaign mode, they need to buy a boat, hire a crew of up to five different crew members and set pots to catch crabs. The crew members are people featured in the show and have different stats (e.g. for setting and retrieving pots) which can be leveled up. Actual gameplay consists of different mini-games: setting and retrieving the pots, sorting the crabs, tossing them into a loading basket and repairing the boat.",
