  "Overview": "An independent project designed using the XNA development suite.\n\nGroov is a frenetic dual-stick shooter that makes you the conductor of an intergalactic jazz fusion orchestra. Every action in Groov has a musical reaction, and with three unique modes, randomized music, and powerups that slow down the song (and your enemies), no two playthroughs are ever alike!",
