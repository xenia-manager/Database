  "Overview": "Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is the sequel to Bit.Trip Runner. The game's look and feel is very different from the original. Runner 2 forgoes the original's retro look in favor of a cartoon art style. The game's story takes on a more humorous tone, and is narrated by Charles Martinet.\n\nThe game expands on the original in several ways. There are several new actions, such as rotating the analog stick to trace Commander Video's path around a loop. In addition, level selection takes place on a map screen laid out similar to other classic platform games. Levels offer alternate paths which can be either easier or harder to complete depending on the path. There are also mid-level checkpoints, though these are optional, and the player earns more points if he/she chooses to skip them. Collecting all gold in each stage allows the player to shoot Commander Video out of a cannon into a target to score extra points.\n\nThere are several characters that can be unlocked, as well as several costumes for each one.\n\nThe game offers 120 levels, online leaderboards for each individual stage, and multiple difficulties for replay value.",
