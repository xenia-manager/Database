  "Overview": "Full description\n\nThe sequel to 2009's Red Faction: Guerrilla has new protagonist Darius Mason traveling deep underground to save the colonists of Mars from a newly awakened evil. As the grandson of the previous game's Alec Mason and Samanya, Darius must utilize the environment to create distractions, disruptions, and destruction. The game features developer Volition's Geo-Mod 2.0 technology for physics-based demolition across volatile areas underneath the planet's surface, from lava tubes to ice caves. Take control of weapons such as the magnet gun and master the all-new abilities of the powerful Nano Forge. In addition to firing concussive blasts, the Nano Forge can be used like a tool to quickly repair damaged areas such as defense structures. Armageddon includes a story-driven single-player campaign, as well as multiplayer co-operative modes.",
