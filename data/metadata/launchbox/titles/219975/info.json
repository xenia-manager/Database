  "Overview": "Conker: Gettin' Medieval was a cancelled spin-off game in the Conker franchise for the Xbox. The game was a Medieval-themed Third-person shooter that featured Gregg the Grim Reaper as the main character instead of Conker (who would've made a guest appearance). The game played similar to the multiplayer of Conker: Live & Reloaded but featured Medieval-themed characters, stages, etc. Siege warfare was also added to the gameplay. It is unknown why the game was cancelled.  \n \nSiege Warfare, Co-operative Multiplayer and Time Traveling escapades would have seen a renaissance in Conker: Gettin’ Medieval; the fledgling efforts of the Live & Reloaded team exclusively dedicated to Xbox Live’s online capabilities. Featuring the pint-sized Gregg the Grim Reaper as its leading character, Conker: Gettin’ Medieval would wage wars across time, where the Sky Knight, Battle Mage and Musketeer could be found within its Medieval realm. While an abundance of concept art was created for the title, Conker: Gettin’ Medieval was cut down in its prime, never to see release.",
