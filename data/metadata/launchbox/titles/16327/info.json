  "Overview": "Resident Evil 4, known as Biohazard 4 (バイオハザード4 Baiohazādo Fō?) in Japan, is a survival horror third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom. The sixth main entry in the Resident Evil horror series, the game was originally released for the GameCube in North America and Japan in January 2005, and in Europe and Australia in March 2005.\n\nThe story of Resident Evil 4 follows the U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the U.S. President's daughter who has been kidnapped by a sinister cult. Traveling to a remote rural area of Europe, Leon fights hordes of violent villagers and mutated monsters, and reunites with the mysterious spy Ada Wong. The game pioneered and popularized the \"over the shoulder\" third-person view perspective in video games.\n\nFirst hinted at in early December 1999, Resident Evil 4 underwent a long development time during which four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him to create a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development over again. The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and in heavily condensed versions for the iOS phones and Zeebo. In April 2013, Resident Evil 4 was launched on Android but only for Samsung smartphones via Galaxy Apps and earlier in 2013 it was available for the Japanese Google Play.[1]\n\nResident Evil 4 garnered universal critical acclaim. It received many Game of the Year awards for 2005, and was seen as a successful cross-platform hit that highly influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person shooter genres. It has since been listed among the best video games of all time.",
