  "Overview": "Power Gig: Rise of the SixString is a rhythm game developed by Seven45 Studios, a sister company of First Act which produces low-cost, entry-level musical instruments. While the game is similar to guitar-based games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Power Gig ships with a unique guitar game controller that acts as both a standalone six-stringed guitar and game controller with note-matching games. Because of the nearness of the controller and gameplay to that of a real guitar, it has attracted musicians including Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, and Kid Rock that have shied away from music games before due to the simplicity of the button-mashing concept. The game is also distributed with the AirStrike, a drum controller that works on motion sensing. The game was shipped on October 19, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.",
