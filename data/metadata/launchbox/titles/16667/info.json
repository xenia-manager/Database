  "Overview": "Spare Parts is a local and online co-op platform game telling the story of heroes Mar-T and Chip, a pair of courageous robots dumped out with the trash by Krofax Lord Sulba Krung - the most hated being in the galaxy, who strips planets of their resources and destroys them to advance his evil empire. \n\nStranded on an isolated planet in the farthest reaches of the galaxy, their only way of escaping is to search for parts and repair an abandoned space ship with the help of ship computer Conrad. The pair must search through caves, jungles and rivers filled with hostile life forms and Lord Krungâ€™s Krofax Troopers. During their travels Mar-T and Chip pick up upgrades to their abilities such as Rocket Boots, X-scanners, Nano Trigger, Power Arms and Magno Boots. There are also several playable robots to rescue.",
