  "Overview": "\"Soldier of Fortune: Payback\" is a first-person shooter video game and the third installment in the \"Soldier of Fortune\" franchise, following \"Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix.\" It is the first game in the series released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with a release date of November 13, 2007. The game's storyline centers on a revenge plot against a global terrorist organization.\n\nUnlike the previous two games, which were developed by Raven Software using the id Tech 2 and id Tech 3 engines created by id Software, \"Payback\" was developed by Cauldron HQ.\n\nThe game received mixed to mostly negative reviews, with critics praising the visuals but describing the gameplay as uninspired. Similar to earlier entries in the series, \"Payback\" featured detailed character modeling and gore effects. Due to its high level of violence, the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia refused to classify the game, effectively banning it. A modified version was later released on April 23, 2008, which removed extreme violence and dismemberment.",
