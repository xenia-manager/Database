  "Overview": "MotoGP 08 is the successor to THQ's motorcycle racing game MotoGP '07 and features the full licensed (18 tracks, 77 drivers and bikes) MotoGP, 250cc and 125cc classes, based on a 5-year deal with Dorna Sports that grants Capcom the worldwide rights for all hardware platforms.\n\nAfter a short tutorial race during which the game helps the player to find the right driving model (Arcade, Advanced or Simulation) best suited for him, he can choose between different game modes with the career being the heart of the game. There the player creates a character, chooses a bike and a helmet for him and starts in the 125cc class with the goal to race to the top of the MotoGP class in only five years. After each successful race the player not only unlocks new content but also gains career points which can be invested into bike upgrades increasing the max speed, acceleration, braking abilities or traction.\n\nThe other game modes are:\nTime Trial - Beat the time records on the different tracks.\n\nTournament - Create a driver or choose a driver from the 2008 season to compete in a series of races.\n\nChallenges - 50 challenges in seven categories demand a great deal of the player to unlock additional game content. Challenges include staying over a certain speed limit for a pre-defined amount of time or winning a 1on1 on the last few meters of a race track.\nThe game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players (not for the PS2 version). It is the first in the series to appear on the PS3. The game introduces the new US Indianapolis track and night racing at the Qatar circuit.",
