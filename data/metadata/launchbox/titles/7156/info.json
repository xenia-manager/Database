  "Overview": "Cabela's African Safari takes you to the wild's of Africa in search of the most valued trophies on the planet. Hunt in 5 different countries like South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, each with their own challenges and perils.\n\nYou have several different firearms, rifles from the .243 (designed mostly for small antelopes) up to the .600 (for big game like Elephants and Rhinos), shotguns for bird hunting and small caliber hand guns designed to protect you against small predators.\n\nEach stage has five hunts, from tracking several small game, one big trophy game, bird hunting, herd hunting, in which you sit in the back of a jeep and try to bring down a trophy animal in the midst of a herd, and finally the Trophy Hunt in which you take down one of the Big 5 of Africa (Rhino, Leopard, Elephant, Cape Buffalo and the Lion). You also have a tracker which gives you clues on where to find your game, a porter to give you advice of which firearm to use and a guide to help you along and set up the hunts. Each hunt has a specific time limit so you won't have time to take in the beautiful surroundings in the game. \n\nThe landscape is populated with all kinds of animals, most harmless and will run when they catch wind of you, but you have to watch out for predators who will attack, especially Hyenas, wild dogs and even leopards and cheetahs. Elephants and rhinos will attack to if they feel provoked.\n\nAfter completing a safari you can play it again in the Open Safari in the main menu if you want to go back to a favorite hunt, plus after you take down the Trophy Hunt animals you can go after them again on the main menu with the option called The Big Five and even hold tournaments to see who is the better hunter. A sure-fire winner for video game hunters.",
