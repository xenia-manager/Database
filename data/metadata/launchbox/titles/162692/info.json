  "Overview": "In Eets: Chowdown, you guide the titular creature Eets through more than 100 levels to collect puzzle pieces with gameplay using combined elements from Lemmings and The Incredible Machine. You do not control Eets directly; instead you use a variety of items to manipulate his path. These items range from whales that spit Eets up to another platform; to mood-altering buds that dictate whether he will make a long jump, a short hop, or shy away from edges altogether.\n\nEach level is divided into a build stage and an action stage. In the build stage the level remains frozen while you are free to place items where you deem appropriate. In the action stage, Eets drops in and begins his trek to the end. Along his path you can activate certain items with button presses, while some remain inactive until Eets comes across them. If Eets claims the puzzle piece, you are graded on time and item-related factors, such as how many you used.\n\nThe other part of Eets: Chowdown, Marsho Madness, places Eets' head in the middle of swarming creatures. You fend them off by entering the button combinations above their heads. If they reach the middle, you lose a life.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version updates the original game Eets: Hunger. It's emotional. with 120 new levels, the Marsho Madness action game and 3 new items. It does not contain the level editor and replay function.",
