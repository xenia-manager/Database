  "Overview": "MotoGP 09/10 is an iteration of the MotoGP racing franchise, featuring content from the 2009 and 2010 racing seasons.\n\nNotable improvements since the 2008 game include a new game engine with improved graphics, 20 player online racing, and a deeper career mode. Players build up their racer in career mode from 125cc bikes, advancing through the 250cc class, until finally achieving the prestigious MotoGP class. In order to advance their racing career, players will have to upgrade their bike, hire staff, and attract sponsors. A revamped arcade mode challenges users to race against the clock throughout a season to see how far they can get with a finite amount of time.\n\nThis is also a more accessible motorcycle game than past iterations with several features to help new users. The game features a new 'second chance' ability where the player can rewind time to retry a challenging section of track. Voiceover guides the player through the career, explaining options and giving racing tips. A difficulty system has been implemented to provide the appropriate level of challenge.",
