  "Overview": "Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created.\n\nThere are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles.\n\nThe multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.",
