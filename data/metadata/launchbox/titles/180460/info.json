  "Overview": "THE iDOLM@STER: Live for You! is a spin-off of the Xbox 360 game THE iDOLM@STER. This game expands on the concert events, particularly customization, from the original game, with concerts being the main focus. The player is a fan of 765 Production studio's idols. Because the their producer is temporarily absent, the studio decides to hire the player to represent the idols. Kotori Otonashi, 765 Production's office clerk who previously appeared in promotional materials, makes her first on-screen appearance in this game, serving as the player's assistant.\n\n10 idols are selectable: Haruka Amami, Chihaya Kisaragi, Yukiho Hagiwara, Yayoi Takatsuki, Ritsuko Akizuki, Azusa Miura, Iori Minase, Makoto Kikuchi, Ami Futami, and Miki Hoshii. After selecting an idol, the player is introduced to them in a random communication event. Then, the player may customize the concert elements, including song, stage, costumes and performance.\n\nConcerts are rhythm mini-games. 6 buttons are used, and correctly pressing them fills up a voltage meter. The higher the meter, the higher the ranking and score. Having a 90% or higher voltage results in song remixes being unlocked.\n\nPlayers can save a video of the concert to the Xbox 360's hard drive. Downloadable content is also available.",
