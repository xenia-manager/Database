  "Overview": "Death Tank mixes the gameplay of Scorched Earth and the Worms series with tanks. The game is set on a single screen 2D battlefield where different tanks are positioned among valleys and mountains, shown from a side view. Players need to move their tanks left and right and target the other tanks by estimating the ballistics of the projectiles, based on shot angle and shot power. The game is played in real-time so it's possible to make consecutive shots with missiles, shells and nukes. Up close it is also possible to fire with a machine gun and health is shown as a small bar above the vehicles.\n\nExtra items allow the tank to fly with jump jets, use super fuel to improve speed, activate a shield, make the tank explode when it is destroyed, and activate AI-precise targeting. Airplanes drop packages and some are buried in the landscape. Additional weapons that can be picked up are lasers, crazy rockets, plasma streams, plasma balls and delay bombs (sticky bombs).\n\nThe game consists of a basic and an advanced combat campaign, each with twenty rounds. Points earned while playing can be spent on twelve different upgrades. Multiplayer is supported to four players locally and eight players online.",
