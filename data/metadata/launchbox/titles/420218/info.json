  "Overview": "This is a remake of the classic PC Engine (Turbo CD) RPG Tengai Makyō: Ziria, the first of the long-running Tengai Makyō series.\n\nThe game is set in the imaginary land of Jipang, which is a parody on the feudal Japan. The legend says that long time ago the great warriors of the Fire Clan were expelled from Eden and had to defeat and to seal the evil demon Masakado. Now, evil has returned to Jipang, and Masakado's resurrection is near. You, a young boy named Ziria, one of the few remaining descendants of the Fire Clan, is the only one who can save the land of Jipang.\n\nThe remake features fully 3D graphics, battles that are viewed from third-person perspective (as opposed to the original first person), additional story events, and more detailed dialogs.",
