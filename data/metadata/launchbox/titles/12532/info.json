  "Overview": "The Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust video game gives gamers an all-access pass to the glitz, glamour, and gorgeous women of Tinseltown. In this third-person adventure game, Larry takes a summer job working on his Uncle Larry's movie lot doing odd jobs and trying to uncover a mole from another studio who threatens to air their dirty laundry in the tabloids. Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust is a rollicking, innuendo-laden lampoon of Hollywood that features open-world sandbox gameplay that uses exploration, platforming, racing, and puzzle-solving to complete missions.",
