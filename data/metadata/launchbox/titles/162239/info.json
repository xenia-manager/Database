  "Overview": "Summer Challenge: Athletics Tournament is a collection of sports events based on the Olympic Summer Games. It features 20 sports divided into eight disciplines: running, throwing, platform diving, jumping, swimming, archery, trampoline and foil fencing. The handling is similar for all of them: rhythmic motions to keep the athlete moving and quick time events (pressing a button when it gets displayed on the screen) for performing certain actions. Of course there are certain variants depending on the discipline, e.g. there are just quick time events for trampoline or foil fencing and the endurance disciplines require a similar stamina for the player. Archery completely depends on the player's ability to aim and estimate the influence of wind; throwing is all about rhythm and using the correct angle.\n\nThe game features a basic career mode where the player gains a fixed amount of experience points after every event which can be reinvested into improved stats (head, arms, legs and body). Fixed challenges have to be completed to unlock more disciplines.",
