  "Overview": "Eschatos takes place in the 22nd century where a mysterious organic alien matter - known only as the Purple Erosion - has taken over The Moon. After covering 75% of The Moon's surface, the aliens launch an attack on the Earth using flying saucers to deploy trajectory weapons and ships. The player is tasked with stopping the invasion using a fighter ship capable of great attack and defense technology.\nThe ship has two modes of fire: the long range Front Shot and the short range Wide Shot. The ship features a regenerative shield capable of absorbing enemy bullets, but with overuse can deteriorate. The game has three game modes including Original, Advanced and Time Attack. In Original mode, there are only two pick-up items including 1Ups and the Flash icon which destroys all enemies and enemy shots on-screen. Advanced mode however includes a few more items including an alternate Flash icon and Power Ups. Collecting Power Ups increase player fire power, but decreases shield percentage.\n\nThe game spans over six stages that are organized with about four to six Areas per stage. There is a unique timing score utilized in each game (Eschatos, Judgment Silver Sword and Cardinal Sins): a timer is set to count up with every enemy wave and boss encounter. The timer stops once all enemies/bosses are defeated and the score is determined with how quickly each enemy wave/boss was destroyed.",
