  "Overview": "Kinect Disneyland Adventures allows players to visit the attractions at the real theme park using the Kinect interface. Instead of simply riding, players participate in an adventure based on the film world represented in that attraction. For example, instead of sitting in a flying boat on the Peter Pan attraction, the character flies in a mini-game with Peter Pan.\n\nThe Park ties together the different games in each attraction. Players interact with Disney characters like Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Dumbo, Cinderella - 40 characters in all. Unlike the games, this is more of an open world where the player's avatar can hug the characters, take pictures with them, get clues and be sent on adventures. In addition to the characters, ordinary objects like trash cans, water fountains, and statues come alive and interact with players.\n\nKDA is a combination of the games in the attractions and the open world that connects them where players meet objectives, perform tasks and get rewards from the characters.",
