  "Overview": "Rayman 4 is an unreleased 3D platform game developed for Ubisoft by Phoenix Studio. Had it not been cancelled, Rayman 4 would have been the first game in the main Rayman series not to be developed by the Ubisoft Montpellier studio.\n\nThe project began in 2005, when concept art was created for various environments and characters. The story is largely unknown, but an early draft may have existed at this point. An unknown amount of programming, modelling, texturing and special effects creation was done during the game's pre-production. The project was discontinued after four months of development.",
