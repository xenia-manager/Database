  "Overview": "Alarm für Cobra 11: Undercover is the ninth game based on the German TV series Alarm für Cobra 11. The player takes control over the policemen Ben Jäger and Semir Gerkhan who are responsible for the safety on the highways near Cologne. In this installment of the series, Jäger goes undercover to infiltrate a gangster organization in order to nail their bosses. Each of the eight cases deals with another criminal and is divided into several missions in which the player alternately takes the role of Jäger or Gerkhan. As usually, the story is only told with voiceovers.\n\nUndercover abandons the open world concept introduced in Crash Time II and goes back to a mission based structure. While there are still some missions which allow freedom, most of the time is spent in linear sections. Most missions consist of normal races or checkpoint races. Sometimes there is also a car chase; either as pursuer or hunted. In the direct predecessors, the player already could use a handgun while driving: in this game there is an extended weapon selection, e.g. a nail board, oil or EMP. The handling is action based and the player never leaves the car. Multiplayer consists of regular races, checkpoint races and an elimination mode.",
