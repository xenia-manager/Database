  "Overview": "Tetris Splash is a modern take on the classic Tetris block building game. The player must rotate and arrange various formations of squares at the bottom of the playing area as they descend from the top to form an uninterrupted horizontal line, from left to right, at the bottom in order to clear the blocks from the playing area before the pile up of unused blocks reaches above the top of the playing area. During gameplay there are several different aquatic based backgrounds behind the game field that include a sunken city and a goldfish bowl. The game also contains an aquarium screensaver that can be personalized through various fish packs.\n\nThe single player mode comes with two variants of Tetris to play. The first one is called Marathon mode and is Tetris. at its basic. All you have to do is clear as many squares from the playing field before space runs out. The second is called 40 line mode and tasks the player with clearing 40 lines of tetris blocks within a time limit.\n\nYou can take on friends in multiplayer through on a single system with up to three other players or five through Xbox Live in which the last man to go bust wins, or general team or free-for-all modes. Combos and cleared lines are used to add grey lines to the other players' fields.",
