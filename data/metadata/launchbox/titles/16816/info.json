  "Overview": "The Biggest Loser Ultimate Workout is a clever \"exer-gaming\" title that challenges you to work out, eat well and \"weigh in\" -- just like the television show. It uses the Kinect for Xbox 360 peripheral, which means you don't hold anything in your hands when playing, and the camera and sensors monitor your movements in real-time. While some parents might not like the title \"The Biggest Loser,\"  for fear of it hurting their children's feelings, the game encourages exercise and makes it fun. There is a sister title to this one for the Wii called The Biggest Loser Challenge, which makes good use of the Wii Balance Board.",
