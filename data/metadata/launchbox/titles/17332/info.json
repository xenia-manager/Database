  "Overview": "NCAA Football 14 is an American football video game published by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon. Part of the NCAA Football series, it is the successor to NCAA Football 13. Despite the game's positive critical and commercial reception, no sequel was produced the following year. Due to legal issues surrounding the game's use of college player likenesses, as of May 2020, NCAA Football 2014 is the last installment of the NCAA Football series. As the most recent entry in the dormant series, the game continues to be played, with unofficial roster updates being released reflecting subsequent seasons.[1] However, the game is now out of print and has become one of the most valuable and sought after games on the PS3 and Xbox 360..",
