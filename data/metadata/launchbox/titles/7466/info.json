  "Overview": "Don King Presents: Prizefighter is a boxing sim that allows you to take control of an up and coming boxer and control his career, both inside and outside of the boxing ring.\n\nDuring bouts you can take down your opponent using all standard boxing moves including uppercuts and hay makers. Governing how well you do are three separate meters: health, adrenaline and stamina. Health governs how much damage you can take and will recharge slightly between rounds. Stamina governs how long you can go before getting worn out, the more punches you throw, the emptier it gets and the fewer effective punches you can land. Adrenaline governs your signature moves. Arenas featured during bouts include the Trumps Taj Mahal, Madison Square Garden and Boardwalk Hall, Atlantic City.\n\nYou can also customize up to five prizefighters and take them online to compete with friends.\n\nThe game also features several famous boxers, past and present, that include Chris Eubank, Joe Calzaghe and Julio César Chávez, Jr.",
