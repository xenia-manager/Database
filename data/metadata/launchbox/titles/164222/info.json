There is also a weapon vending machine that can produce anything from freeze guns and shotguns, even mini-guns to more cartoonish-type like a bear-trap launching gun and the classic spring-loaded boxing glove.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar, jumping, punching, shooting, the basic 3-D platform type with the exception of the Wii with the ability to use the remote and nunchuk. The health system is the same, but the players can cycle through each character, if one character dies it will then switch to another until the list of characters is exhausted resulting the player to restart to the last checkpoint.\n\nIt does have a multiplayer option as well and basically are the same, but the Playstation 2 version has an exclusive level and skins for the characters.",
