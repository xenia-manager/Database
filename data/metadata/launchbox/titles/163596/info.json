  "Overview": "Phantom Breaker is a fighting video game developed and published by 5pb. for the Xbox 360 in June 2011. An arcade version of the game running on Sega's RingEdge 2 arcade board, titled Phantom Breaker: Another Code, was released in April 2013. In addition, an enhanced edition, titled, Phantom Breaker: Extra, was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2013.\n\nPhantom Breaker is a 2D fighting game that supports two distinctive fighting styles, the player is able to choose between \"Quick\" style and \"Hard\" style. Quick style focuses on quick hits and combos while the other is more about defense.\n\nWhen the player reaches \"Overdrive\" mode, their character might get an extra increase in speed or defense. Every attack the player releases can cancel out their enemy's attack and raise their tension gauge; timing it right will maximize the player's gauge to boost their attack power.",
