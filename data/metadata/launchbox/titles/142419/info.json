  "Overview": "Play as Johnny Platform himself in this retro-styled platformer! Do death-defying double-jumps and solve puzzles in your quest to defeat the evil robot army… and don’t forget to drink plenty of coffee along the way.\n\nJPBR started out as a DS homebrew game, and was later ported to Xbox Live Indie Games. Development time for both versions combined was around 2-3 weeks, so it’s a little rough around the edges but still plays nicely. The Xbox version comes with 5 extra levels, plus some re-ordering of the existing levels for difficulty balancing.",
