  "Overview": "Double D Dodgeball is an Xbox Live Arcade game, much like table football, in that you control a team of dodgeball players, from a top down perspective, combined with graphics similar to those seen in another XBLA game, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.\n\nYou can choose between 2 sets of rules, named 'east' and 'west' as well as switch between different ball types and playing surfaces, amongst other options.\n\nDouble D Dodgeball also features a 4 player co-op mode, with 2 teams, both consisting of 2 human players and 2 AI players in a 4v4 game. It can also be played over Xbox Live with 7 other people, again in a 4v4 game.",
