  "Overview": "Self-Defense Training Camp is a Kinect-only game that aims to teach players how to defend themselves in situations where they feel threatened. The game takes place in a dojo where the player goes through different exercises with a training partner in what-if scenarios. Exercises are performed by mimicking the shown gestures and movement, combining fitness with self-defense. The character is rendered semi-transparent to make the attacker also visible. The player's performance is graded based on four statistics: technique, stamina, composure and reflexes.\n\nSupplementary training sessions exists of yogo (presented as meditation to stay calm is stressful situations, by following the on-screen prompts), fighting activities (punching, boxing, kicking), and a cardio session.",
