  "Overview": "Grease Dance is a 2011 rhythm dance game developed by ZoÃ« Mode and published by 505 Games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Based on the 1978 film Grease (which itself is based on the 1971 musical of the same name), the game requires either PlayStation Move or Xbox Kinect. The game also includes 20 songs, 15 of which are from the original movie. It is the second game to be based on Grease, following 2010's Grease, which was partially created by the same developer.\nThe title's standard mode is \"Dance\" which has players mimicking motions that appear on the screen to music using either a PlayStation Move or Kinect (depending on the console). Only 15 of the game's 20 songs are available to dance to. In multiplayer, players may complete head to head or perform a coop dance routine. One competitive mode exclusive to multiplayer is \"Challenge\", which has players performing a dance routine while also completing small tasks throughout the song, such as freezing in place for a set number of time. Also, available is Karaoke, which allows players to use a USB microphone or the built-in mics on the PlayStation Eye or Kinect to sing the song as it plays. Up to eight players may play at once using \"Party mode\", in which two teams consisting of two singers and two dancers face off against each other. In all modes, players can earn a score multiplier by completing five or more pages with an \"Ok\" or higher rating, which increases the amount of points earned for a move.\n\nPlayers can also unlock film clips and mini-games based on movie scenes to play, most of which don't involve the core aspect of dancing or singing. For example, the \"Thunder Road Race\" mini-game is a racecourse in which players use hand gestures to boost and steer their car in a head-to-head race with the computer.",
