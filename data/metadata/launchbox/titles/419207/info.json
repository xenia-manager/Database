  "Overview": "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is based on the wildly popular and Emmy-award winning game show of the same name that debuted in 1999 and has been in U.S. daily syndication since September 2002. \"Is that your final answer?\" has become a popular catch phrase in popular vocabulary.\n\nYou take the hot seat in the all-new Who Wants To Be A Millionaire game. Win $1,000,000 by correctly answering 15 multiple-choice questions, each worth an increasing amount of money. Just like on TV, you can seek help for the super stumper questions via lifelines like \"Ask the Audience\", \"Double Dip\", or \"Phone a Friend\". Can you stand the pressure, or will you walk away?",
