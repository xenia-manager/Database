  "Overview": "Atari's arcade tank combat game Battlezone is redesigned and re-released for Xbox Live Arcade. Players can choose from a port of the original arcade game, with wireframe vector graphics intact, or an \"Evolved\" version, with particle effects and Tron-like shaded graphics. Each mode has an regular mode and a \"Throttle Monkey\" mode, where the speed is greatly increased.\n\nPlayers control a battle tank as it wheels around a virtual battlefield. In single-player, players use a radar at the top of the screen to track down and shoot enemy vehicles before they can be shot themselves. In versus, players driving their own tanks try to track down and destroy each other. Towers and trees littering the battlefield act as both obstacles and cover. Tanks have unlimited ammo, but take valuable time to reload.\n\nTwo modes of control are available. The first uses the left stick to drive the tank forward or backward. The second mode recreates the arcade controls, and has each stick controlling either the left or right tread. By running one tread and not the other, the tank will turn, with more advanced moves available to players who master the selective use of each tread.\n\nPlayers can fight the A.I. alone to rack up their highest score, or take on up to four opponents online with Xbox Vision support. Additional multiplayer modes beyond Versus have been added to this port, adding Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag to the lineup.",
