  "Overview": "Blackwater is a first-person shooter where the player controls operatives Devin, Baird, Smash, and Eddie. The game takes place is in village in North Africa, and players are tasked with all kinds of different jobs modern day soldiers also face during wartime. This includes protecting aid workers and civilians.\n\nThe country is overrun by a warlord named General Limbano. He and his soldiers must not become the death of those civilians. This is the reason America has sent a team of operatives. Whilst controlling the main characters, players move along a set path, optionally using features of the Kinect peripheral to control the character and kill enemies. Targets must be highlighted by moving your hand above their heads and hovering over them for a few seconds to shoot. To take cover, players must duck and lean side-to-side.\n\nDevin and Baird use assault rifles. As Smash, the player uses a shotgun and as Eddie, a sniper rifle. Throughout each stage in the game, there are moments where the player has to perform actions such as jumping across gaps or breaking down doors.",
