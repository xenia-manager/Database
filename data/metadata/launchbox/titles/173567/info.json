  "Overview": "MotoGP 10/11 is the season 2010/2011 release of the MotoGP racing series for Xbox 360. It features the drivers list and tracks from the 2010/2011 racing seasons. Both wet and dry weather condition are simulated, as well as racing team management.\n\nThe player can drive single races, time trials, challenges, and or develop a career and drive the tracks of season 2010/2011 in the following classes: 125cc, Moto2 and MotoGP. Extensive bike tuning options will help the player to get the shortest lap times possible by matching the bike to a track. Furthermore driver suit and bike paint job customisation contains many options for schemes and colours. The auto assist features allow the driver to customise from arcade style to high fidelity realistic moto racing simulation. The arcade style is more forgiving, while the full simulation requires requires the driver to handle all driving techniques by him/herself. The game also provides racing team management, where the entire engineering crew and staff are there to support the driver.\n\nWhat's new from previous release is improved physics modelling. The Co-op mode, Voice over and 2nd chance features have remained. What also has remained is the 100% customisable control layout, and the online racing options.",
