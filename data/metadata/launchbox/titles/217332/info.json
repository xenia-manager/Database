  "Overview": "Assassin's Creed III: The Tyranny of King Washington - The Infamy is a DLC (download content) for Assassin's Creed III and the first episode of the King Washington storyline. The story is set in an alternate timeline in which Ratonhnhaké:ton - the one known as Connor in the main game - never joined the Assassins and George Washington crowned himself as King of America after the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn this episode, which is spent in the Wilderness, Ratonhnhaké:ton is confronted with the problems this King brings to himself and his people. He learns two new powerful abilities which enable him to call upon the powers of the wild: he can turn himself invisible and summon wolves for assistance (the mechanics are similar to the Assassin recruits of the main game).",
