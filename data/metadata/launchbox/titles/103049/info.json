  "Overview": "Capcom Arcade Cabinet is a hub game similar to Game Room, Pinball FX2 and Hasbro Family Game Night where players download a hub and then can buy several additional games that act as add-ons to the main hub games. After the main release of the game, four (Xbox 360) and five (PS3) Game Packs were released the following weeks, for a total of fifteen games eventually, with the same titles for each platform. Two additional games, 1943 Kai and Vulgus are provided if you buy all five Game Packs or through the large compilation Game Pack Capcom Arcade Cabinet: All-in-One Pack. \n\nAll included titles are classic Capcom arcade games originally released between 1984 and 1988 and some of them are converted to a console for the first time. Some of the games include multiplayer, both offline and online, the option to adjust lives and difficulty level, an infinite lives training mode, leaderboards, and the option to choose between the Japanese or international version. The soundtrack can also be accessed and it is possible to record videos and upload them to YouTube (PS3) or upload screenshots to Facebook (Xbox 360). Most of the Game Packs include trial versions for the others games and all of the games, except for the two secret ones, can also be purchased individually.\n\nThe base hub game this entry covers is different for the two platforms. For the PS3 the hub game is provided for free and players have access to the full version of Black Tiger. For the Xbox 360 version the base hub is not free, but it includes three full games:\n\n- 1943: The Battle of Midway\n- Black Tiger\n- Avengers",
