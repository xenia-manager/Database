  "Overview": "Damage Inc.: Pacific Squadron WWII is an arcade flying game that follows the major battles in the Pacific Theater of WWII. Damage Inc. features a full campaign mode of 21 missions, online co-op play for four players through the entire campaign, and online multiplayer with five game modes: Dogfight, Team Dogfight, Survivor, Team Survivor, and Scratch One Flat-top.\n\nThe campaign mode follows the exploits of Bobby Williams, a crack pilot whose tour of duty takes him from Pearl Harbor just moments before the Japanese surprise attack all the way to the critical final assault on Iwo Jima which secured the last Japanese stronghold in the Pacific. Along the way the campaign highlights all of the key battles of the war, including the fall of Wake Island, the decisive naval battles of the Coral Sea, the wresting of Guadalcanal from the Japanese, the counter-attack against the Japanese fleet in Midway, and the final naval battles on the Philippines.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign players unlock new planes, and earn bonus points to upgrade their planes to better versions. The game includes over 90 unique planes based on over 45 models. Damage Inc includes all of the key planes of WWII from the Pacific and European theaters, including the Zero, Hellcat, Warhawk, Corsair, Avenger, Dauntless, Lightning, Mustang, Bearcat, Shooting Star, Spitfire, Tempest, Bf-109, Jack, Randy, and Frank.",
