  "Overview": "Hardwood Backgammon is an electronic conversion of the Backgammon board game. It stays true to the original game, but offers a few options to alter the rules, such as determining the number of match points to win the game (with a maximum of 129 points) or disallowing use of the doubling cube. The game can be played alone, with three different difficulty levels, or against another player as both local and online multiplayer games are supported. Also included is a number of tutorials that explain the basic rules. Pressing a button rolls the dice and after that all open moves can be cycled to insert checkers. Dots indicate where the pieces can land. However, indicators do not mark where a checker could move if you combine dice totals, a feature sometimes supported by other titles.",
