  "Overview": "Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet is a side-scrolling action game in which an alien in a small flying saucer has to defeat a bizarre life form from outer space that had infected the alien's homeworld and also the sun. You have to steer the UFO through different mazes like caves, underwater terrain, ice cavern, or mechanical areas while fighting strange creatures. From time to time you find upgrades for your ship and also additional weapons and equipment for the saucer's robot arm which allows you to open different passages to new areas, like e.g. in the Metroid games.",
