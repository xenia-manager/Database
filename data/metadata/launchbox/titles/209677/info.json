And so began the Great Clown Invasion. Join Jaxx, the wise-cracking jester, and his beautiful enigmatic partner in crime, Comedia. Armed with a map that reveals the secret location of the Orbs, Jaxx and Comedia soon find themselves on the run from the Clown Army. With Comedia captured, you must guide Jaxx to rescue her AND stop the map from falling into the hands of those diabolical, evil, merciless, despicable, Clowns!",
