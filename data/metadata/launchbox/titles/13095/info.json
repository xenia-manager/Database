  "Overview": "As an over-the-shoulder brawler starring my super-powered Xbox Live Avatar, PowerUp Heroes is a fun concept. When it worked, I could see why this could have been a good time. I'm not ashamed to have dug its fast-paced fist-fighting for kids. It takes an accessible, uncomplicated approach to combat, and this winds up working in the game's favor and against it.\n\nMy hero walked into each street fight with two suits I could swap between on the fly. Each brought three distinctly powerful attacks to the table in addition to my ranged blasts and unmatched face-punching skill. If my on-screen Mitch followed through when I told him what to do, the sensation of raising the dead with an arm lift made me feel like a godly puppet master. I was awesome, no denying it, when blocking a barrage of melee attacks. I felt cool lashing out with lightning whips and letting loose with anime-esque energy balls, too.",
