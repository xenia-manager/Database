  "Overview": "In nail'd, the player takes the place of the driver participating in the off-road racing tournament. The only vehicles allowed are ATV (All Terrain Vehicle aka quad bike) and MTX (motocross bike).\n\nThe events are led at breakneck tracks in settings like Greece or Yosemite National Park. Unlike ones from another racing games, they are built from extreme turns (imagine 70 degree downhill and then three-way crossroad, leading to a hairpin turn), trampoline jumps hundreds of meters high and wide variety of ways to ride through. \n\nIn order to fit such hazardous environment, player has to upgrade his vehicle by installing better spare parts, unlocked after winning certain leagues. Each league consist of numerous events, either basic races or stunts challenges, where winner is decided by amount of points received by performing tricks (like perfect landing, jumping through rings in air and destroying opponents). Sometimes, so-called \"mutators\" are turned on, for example unlimited nitro.\n\nBesides default tournament, custom one could be created. Also, quick and multiplayer races are available, up to 12 contestants, or time trial with ghost, where results gather at on-line leaderboards.",
