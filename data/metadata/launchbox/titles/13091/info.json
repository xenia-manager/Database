  "Overview": "Lips is a singing game in the vein of Sony's SingStar series of games. Much like the popular past time of karaoke, players sing along to the lyrics of songs that are displayed on-screen. The game also judges you based on pitch, earning you points based on how accurately you sang. At certain points in the game, players are prompted to perform gestures with the microphone (such as tilting it upwards). When they do this, the bonus 'Star Stream' mode is activated which earns even more points.\n\nLips can be played in either Solo, VS, or Co-Op modes. At any time during solo play, a second player can shake their wireless mike to create a multiplayer game. VS mode is a battle for the highest score, while Co-Op has players working together to achieve a high score. If both players trigger Star Stream simultaneously in co-op, their star bonuses are doubled.\n\nThere are also special game modes for those who want to try something different: in Kiss, the on-screen couple gets closer together the better that both players sing. When they get close enough, you'll be prompted to tilt your mikes up to make them kiss. Time Bomb lights a bomb's fuse at the start of the song. By singing well, you'll fill a glass up with water - when there's enough water inside, use it to extinguish the fuse.\n\nPlayers who don't want to sing can still participate by using a controller as a Noise Maker. This allows them to add sound effects such as snapping fingers, cowbells, tambourines and even crowd noise to the song.\n\nThe song list is localized for different countries, with certain tracks only included in the version for specific regions. Below is the main track list that is largely shared across versions.
