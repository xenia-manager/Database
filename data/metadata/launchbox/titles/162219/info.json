  "Overview": "Developed by Petroglyph, this combat-intensive real-time strategy game enlists players in an epic struggle to prevent total alien domination of planet Earth. Universe at War: Earth Assault is set in the near-future when multiple factions from across the galaxy have come to Earth to wage epic warfare. Containing numerous features and customization options never-before-seen in the RTS genre, Universe at War: Earth Assault creates an exceptional strategy experience for single-player and especially multiplayer battles. The game employs a unique balance system called \"Tactical Dynamics\" that allows players to retrain and customize units in the midst of battle to better cope with enemy forces and tactical situations. Weaponry and defenses can be modified in true real-time to take advantage of constantly shifting battlefield conditions. Fully customizable tech trees allow players to control the development of technologies that they deem key to victory. Battles in Universe at War: Earth Assault are large in scope and take place in malleable and deforming environments. Deadly sci-fi weapons and alien powers will allow players to destroy cities and whole territories on a global scale. Because the world of Universe at War: Earth Assault is persistent, players can revisit previous battlegrounds to find them still smoldering in ruins. The game gives players achievements points, rewards, and medals in a balanced environment to further encourage players to move forward in the game. Players from around the world battle in persistent-style online campaigns for ultimate faction supremacy across a virtual representation of the Earth. The Xbox 360 game employs a control scheme built from the ground up to ensure smooth gameplay and ease of command for console gamers.",
