  "Overview": "Dr. Diggabone's getting too old for archaeological digs, or so he says. Truth be told, he's just plain lazy That's where you jump into Lazy Raiders and take control as you spin and flip mazes to send the Doctor or your Avatar on a gravity-defying quest for lost relics that would bring him instant fortune and glory. Of course you'll have to deal with greedy thieves, pesky minions, and ingenious traps along the way. If there weren't any challenges, you'd just grow lazy and we wouldn't want that, would we?",
