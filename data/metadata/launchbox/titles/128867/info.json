  "Overview": "Not to be confused with the original Alien Breed 2, Alien Breed 2: Assault is a sequel to series reboot Alien Breed: Evolution. Though the \"Chapter\" monikers have now been dropped, Assault is still the second part of the story started in Evolution.\n\nAssault picks up with the story of Chief Engineer Theodore Conrad, and his attempt to escape the alien-infested starship Leopold. Players move with the left stick and aim with the right, though ammo conservation is much more of a concern than in traditional dual-stick shooters. The fundamental gameplay change in the sequel is an upgrade system allowing players to purchase weapon upgrades and inventory items at stations throughout the levels. Escort missions also play a greater role, where the player must protect an A.I. partner while they unlock doors or barriers. A few new weapons (Hyper Blaster and Rocket Launcher), as well as new Breed types also make appearances.\n\nAssault's story takes place over five lengthy levels. Completed levels can also be replayed in solo \"Free Mode,\" with players trying to top their high score. The game also features an online or offline co-op campaign, using redesigned maps and a new story that crosses with the solo campaign. The sequel also features a new \"Survival\" mode, playable solo or in co-op, where players defend against hordes of charging enemy A.I.",
