  "Overview": "Jumper: Griffin's Story is an extension of the movie, Jumper, that starred Hayden Christensen. This version tells the story of the Jumper, Griffin, which was portrayed by Jamie Bell in the movie and voiced by him in the game, telling the backstory of how he learned of being a jumper and the family tragedy that lead him into war against the Paladins.\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploring levels, fighting enemies in hand-to-hand combat or using weapons using the teleport ability to get close enough to enemies and retreating, picking up weapons and using the ability to teleport to other locations to finish off his enemies. There are five different locations to explore: The Colosseum, Griffinâ€™s desert lair, Nepal, Tokyo and an experimental laboratory.\n\nThe games are virtually the same, sans graphics and control scheme (the Wii uses the Wii remote) with the story is told through CGI and gameplay graphics are cell-shaded.",
