  "Overview": "Shrek-N-Roll is a small game based off the characters of the animated Shrek films, with Shrek as the giant green ogre and a host of friends and enemies, such as Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, Charming, ... Completing every level eventually makes 24 characters available, with only aesthetic differences and no influence on the gameplay.\n\nGameplay is based around balancing a baby Shrek snack in the form of a ball in levels usually in the form of a tower. There is a character positioned on either side of the screen, with in between a beam where the snack rolls, like guiding a marble on a see-saw or a labyrinth tilt-and-roll game. Each analogue stick controls a character, left and right, as they contort a crank to raise and lower the beam to collect coins, extra snacks, and extra lives. They also have to dodge windows, and purple vortexes (some of them moving about) that suck the snack inside and require to restart the level. By varying how the sticks are moved, the angle of the beam changes. To complete a level, a number of snacks needs to be fed to Baby Shrek without losing too many along the way. Some levels have a little variation where Baby Shrek for instance licks the ball, making it more sticky and easier to control.\n\nThere are 16 levels in total, based on 4 environments from the films such as The Swamp or Evil Queen's Castle. Multiplayer is supported locally, for two players, in a cooperative or a versus mode. In versus the screen is split vertically and introduces power-ups to steal the opponent's multiplier or have his beam disappear for a short while. The goal is to be the first to reach the ogre baby at the top.",
