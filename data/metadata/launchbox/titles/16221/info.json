  "Overview": "ro Evolution Soccer 2010 follows the yearly instalments of the football franchise and comes with up-to-date player transfers for the 2009/2010 season. The game features many new moves and the players move more slowly and realistic. Even a mediocre player can now have a lucky strike and hit the net from 40 meters away. Most graphical improvements go into the detail of players' faces and shadows. Although there are still five levels of gameplay, this time the computer AI acts differently from before and opens up new ways to play the game.\n\nThere are game modes present from earlier titles in the franchise, such as Exhibition or Master League, but also some new ones like UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Become a Legend mode introduced in PES 2009 is also available. Aside from graphics, details were put into tactics and strategy where players can be positioned with more accuracy, according to his talent. An entirely new feature is the card system, tied to certain players' unique abilities. This gives that player an advantage over its opponent. In previous titles certain top players could perform stunning moves without the player's control. With the card system in PES 2010 directly control over this becomes available.\n\nThe Master League mode is more detailed and comes with sponsors, youth teams and real currencies (including Euro, British Pound, US Dollar, or Japanese Yen). Money can also be used to pay a scout who deals with negotiations, physical aspects, the trainer and other staff members. The Premier League, Liga Espanola, Italian League, Eredivisie and others are still included, as well as World Cup, Konami Cup and others, with national teams and league teams largely up-to-date.\n\nUnlike earlier instalments, the player's individual graphical representation is gone. It is still possible to see them as a part of an entire team, but no longer for individual players. This means it takes time to get acquainted with them by going through numerical statistics or checking the compatibility of the players' maximum performance with the position they are at.\n\nCo-op is on par with the franchise, with assisted player switching and semi-assisted and manual switching. Manual meaning is complete and the player will not be switched until it is determined by the player, while semi-automatic will switch to the player a pass is given to.",
