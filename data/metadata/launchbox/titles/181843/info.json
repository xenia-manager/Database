  "Overview": "Uno Rush evolves the typical rules of Uno into a fast paced card game where the old tactics of the game are thrown out the window. Each player can now see the others cards as each round begins. You then have a set time limit to play your hand, based on either the number or colour of the card on the play field. You can re-order the cards in your hand while you wait for your turn to arrive, and if you plan it quick enough, you can play all your cards in one move (matching a colour or number in order) while calling 'Uno!', all in the space of a few seconds. The aim of the game is, as always, be the last person to have no cards remaining.\n\nAll the other cards of the Uno deck are playable, draw two, draw four, reverse or skip. There's also a shuffle card that can, as the card suggests, shuffle the next players deck of cards before they get their turn. You can create your own house rules, changing up the speed, or the command cards playable, the kinds of penalties and more.\n\nThere's plenty of multiplayer modes and options available, from the standard online modes to local multiplayer for four players, and connection through Xbox Live Party mode. Your character appearance can vary from your Xbox Live avatar, or your own self by using the Xbox camera.",
