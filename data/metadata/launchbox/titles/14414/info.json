  "Overview": "Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure is the first video game in the Skylanders series. It is a video game that is played along with toy figures that interact with it through a \"Portal of Power\", that reads their tag through NFC and features the voices of Josh Keaton, Dave Wittenberg, Darin De Paul, Joey Camen, Audrey Wasilewski, Keythe Farley and Kevin Michael Richardson.\n\nSkylanders Spyro's Adventure was published by Activision and developed by Toys for Bob.
