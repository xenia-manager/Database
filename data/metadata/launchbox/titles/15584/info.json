  "Overview": "Gal*Gun is a rail shooter and bish≈çjo game. Player controls the protagonist, Tenzou to shoot his female classmates with \"Pheromone Arrow\", while he moves automatically through predetermined route on each stage. Girls runs towards the player trying to profess their love via notes or screams that must be prevented by shooting them. If player fails to do so, this results in damage to his HP. The girls they've been shot receives euphoria, subduing them in process. Each girl has their own weak point in their body that results in \"Ecstasy Shot\", subduing them immediately if shot. As the game progresses through each stage, the player may confront female teachers that must be shot multiple times, making them harder to subdue.\n\nThe shooting is broken up by \"action events\" similar to that of a boss battle, as well as a \"Doki Doki Mode\" (\"heart pounding\" in English) where the player has the option to zoom in and stare at the selected girl.[5]\n\nThe developer also added a panic button that switches the action for a retro-looking game, with authentic animations and sounds. This is referred to as a Mama kita gamen or \"Mom arrived screen\".[6]\n\nIn the original Xbox 360 version, the player could control the camera below the hemline of the girl during Doki Doki Mode. However Microsoft ordered the game publisher, Alchemist to eliminate this feature by releasing \"Panties Protect Patch\"[sic] update on March 18, 2011",
