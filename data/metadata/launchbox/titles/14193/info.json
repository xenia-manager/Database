  "Overview": "The Kinect's second dance title features two-player simultaneous action, multiple play modes, and an assortment of original songs to groove to. Standing in front of the Kinect, you'll attempt to move your hands and feet to the beat while using your body to perform various poses. Four difficulty settings determine how much activity you'll need to do to complete each of the 30 songs, but for those still having trouble, a lesson mode is included to help you with the core play mechanics. You can also record and save your dance moves and assign them to a backup dancer, or take a picture of a pose to store in a local photo album or to share with friends. Up to four players can compete online via Xbox Live, or you can strut your stuff with a friend or family member to see who can rack up the highest score. Expand the game's dance sequences and music selections with optional downloadable content.",
