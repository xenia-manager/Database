## üåê Data Information

### Game Information

- **Xenia Stable Compatibility List:**  
  [stable.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenia-manager/Database/refs/heads/main/Database/Game%20Compatibility/stable.json)  
  `Database/Game Compatibility/stable.json`

- **Xenia Canary Compatibility List:**

  Each folder under `Xbox Marketplace/` corresponds to a specific title ID. For example:

  - **Example Title Folder:**  
    [Xbox Marketplace/TitleID/<TitleID>.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenia-manager/Database/refs/heads/main/Database/Xbox%20Marketplace/303407D4/303407D4.json)  
    `Database/Xbox Marketplace/<TitleID>/<TitleID>.json`

- **Launchbox Database (Currently outdated):**  
  [launchbox_games.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenia-manager/Database/refs/heads/main/Database/launchbox_games.json)  
  `Database/launchbox_games.json`

- **Wikipedia List of Xbox360 Games (No longer used):**  
  [wikipedia_games.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenia-manager/Database/refs/heads/main/Database/wikipedia_games.json)

## How It Works

- **Data Format:**  
  All files are in JSON format, making them easy to parse in any programming language.

- **Autoupdate:**  
  The `update_database.yml` GitHub Actions workflow automatically updates game compatibility and patch data twice a day by fetching the latest information from official Xenia sources and relevant repositories.

- **Usage:**  
  Fork the repository.
  You can fetch and use these files in your own tools, scripts, or applications.
